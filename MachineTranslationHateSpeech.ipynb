These days cows and dogs are more important than humans also the hate created by BJP,  and RSS has to be cleared. It\\'s not a cultural festival...CPI (M) people held the beef fest in protest...the point is since when did people in Kerala start talking in such communal terms ....the BJP is trying very hard to get a foothold in Kerala and what better instrument than inciting communal violence in the name of cow and beef as they are doing in north India Shahid RASHID....u pig....what r u saying Nice for....u feel happy abt this...???\\nShame on u....be ready for the  consequences.

Shame India Such a sold out media, the video was about the 5000 year glorious country we should protect.and here only focus is on half a sentence inside a 13 min video. Today I get up at 03:00 am after hearing the song of Sonu Nigam. Banned him too. He disturbed me while I was deeply sleeping. Its like duke 390 why they took so much time to launch it.  Just give a name & changing some out look & reduce price ???? Of course, when majority community is so bad, that they even have problem to rent house to Muslims. When fanancial status of Muslims is degrading for their business not running, not getting enough jobs in private sector etc, then it\\'s government duty to give reservation, and act as role model. Some suggestions\\n1) Like aadhar card make it mandatory to have ATM/Debit Card.\\n2)Every business outlet small or big shall have swiping machines/paytm like arrangement. It must be made mandatory to run business.\\n3)Stop printing Rs.2000/_ immediately. And in future Rs.500/- . If not demonitize them six months before every election. All elections hence shall be conducted on the same date henceforth.\\n4)like indirect taxes integration, integrate all direct taxes & collect them through transaction tax from bank as arthakranti suggested. \\n5) Continue cash withdrawal restrictions even after Dec 31st. 2016. Reduce cash usage eventually and limit to Rs.5000/- per month to individuals and Rs.20000/- to 100000/- to businesses as per their turnover.\\n6) Gst shall be collected at first billing. Stop input credit and collect turnover tax basing on turnover of distribution, service providers, and other small businesses. \\n\\nMore in later dates......

Yes and I can also never forget on how you tricked me and drove the SUV saying you are regularly driving. The RSS should learn humanity, it\\'s they that are behind pogroms in India.  The JNU is merely advocating human rights and rule of the law that\\'s enshrined in India\\'s secular and progressive constitution. 1) Find a problem and then find a solution and if the solution helps the society..great.

Spot on...but it should apply across the spectrum of religions. No one has a right to disturb anyone in the guise of religion and blaring of loudspeakers should be in conformity with the supreme court guidelines. Dear Indian Express,\\nI feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. \\nA fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake. http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/ During his rule in Bihar, the pilgrims had to bow before his photo and then proceed on their journey, such a great king he was. Please tell about \\nCarbodrum universal\\nIntellect design arena\\nJp assc\\nEither one please suggest Please share ur views on Lic housing fin and idea The case is stil there its not yet finished Arrest  that corrupted judge. I think corrupted Government and Corrupted judges deserve death sentence like those traitors Cows are live stocks .Lynching for stealing cows by villagers happened in my state Odisha too & those were killed was Hindus. #NDTV should\\'nt paint this in communal colour.

What these companies were doing when they knew it well in advance . I would urge the honorable to inflict fine on these companies as well as the state Govt where these companies are located . First, let them ban it in Manipur where they are in power. Whatever wipro is growing but what is happening in the root is not notified by anyone which is very bad. If someone is going to come for audit then that person use to come before the audit days and use to inform everything what he is going to do . And if something is wrong than also bosses over there use to protect the person who is responsible for that and on opposite side person working on 3rd party were forced to do work for everyone and they use to get scolding on regular basis without any reason How do u intend to deal hackers and secure these transactions. we need more like him.. bloody Kashmiris should learn from him What to do if a male colleague keeps staring at your breasts? what about triple talak why supreme court hesitate to give justice to muslim women later on halala He admits it is their govt fault..as delhi police comes under centre Anna fooled the country, kejriwal befooled Anna. Kejjriwal believes in modern technology, Use and Throw. We give u place to live and now u r talking against Pak. I m also from Afghani tribe. I hate India and Afghani like u. Go to hell Ahmedzai Says the man who stole all the ideas from Tesla So he joined bjp internally. Thank god, India\\'s fate  is not in the hsnds of communists. West Bengal still a backward state, while Kerala still worse. But keralites are clever, they vote for communists and fly to foreign countries for earnings They will put the blame on Kashmiri terrorists.  But Pakistan is responsible and should be punished.

How come Pakistani army did surgical strike n Indian army had no knowledge of it. How Pakistani went back safely. \\n\\nIt all happened at a time when Turkish President was advocating talks on Kashmir.... \\n\\nTo me India has killed its own army personnel to blame Pakistan and prove Turkish president advocacy wrong. We have seen it in past as well especially at the time when Indian army massacred a Sikh village of Kashmir and blamed Pakistan for it. All this was done to get sympathy from US president Bill Clinton who came to advocate talks on Kashmir...! Swami Vivekananda also said:\" The society where women are not respected can never prosper.\"His words are more relevant today than they were during his lifetime in view of the rising crimes against  women in our society .Swamiji also started the tradition of \\'kumari pujo\\' where a young girl is worshipped as part of Goddess Durga on the Navami day of Durga puja. RSS people starts boiling when any body says about secularism and start giving their own bised definition of secularism. This communal thought was first inducted by Sarwarkar in the year 1910 in Indian freedom straggle and and terminated at the birth of  RSS in 1925 along with another communal organisation MUSLIM  LEAGUE. These organisations seldom taken part in the straggle of India. Poor people and farmers are suffering big time and they are definitely not black money hoarders.

I don\\'t think you can debate Yogi on Hinduism and/or Indian politics. How did you know that he is a goon, did you belong to his group or what, how do you prove that you are not a goon as well? Modi can never select a goon for CM for the largest state of India.

Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.\\n\\nTrump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East.

Ambani enjoying ....people crying...down crude price but people not get benifit.... Hi Anuj Does MOIL also falls in your Metal Bull Market theory ... This budget is loudly saying that DEMONETIZATION was a damp squib. If concessions in taxation is given there would loss of revenue to the government. Unless there are ways to make good this loss, concessions cannot be given. Had demonetization been successful in curbing the black money, the govt. would have had extra revenue to allow concession in personal taxation. Since the concession in this score is nominal, if not negative taking inflation into account, it is written on the face of the Union Budget, 2017 that there is very little success in curbing the black money by demonetization.  On the other hand govt. needed money for several welfare schemes and definite sources to raise this money. Since independence salaried class is the most certain source of tax revenue and thus govt. decided to take it for a ride for another time. The persons who got delighted thinking that the ill gotten  wealth of the dishonest people in their neighbourhood would now be caught, are probably still not aware of it. If they are still delighted by seeing the budget analysis on TV and think that this budget is a great booster for rural and infrastructure sector here is one statistics. Last year allocation to railways was Rs.1.21 lakh crores; this year due to the so-called thrust on infrastructure the amount is 1.31 lakh crore. If this allocation is discounted for inflation the figure seems to be less than that of the last year. What about the Government Salary Doctors who are also earning from their private practice...?\\nWhich form they have to fill...? Just Dial rallied in the end ..Reason for so rally HOW CAN U CHARGE MORE THAN U GIVE, WHERE INTEREST ON SAVING AC IS LESS, UTTER FINANCIAL & ECONOMIC DISASTER.. Sickular spotted..

Then these cheaters will lose their property to the government Why our Honourable PM is saying\\n\"Some forces are up against him, they may not leave him alive\"\\nFor entire nation this is a terrible thing when our own PM do not feel safe.\\nWho are those people, are they more powerful than India?\\nIs he talking about internal security breach? Haha trying to legitimize their claim and show the world they are victims. Bloody fanatic media secularism- is not an easy thing. I can say no political party is true secular in its behaviour. some appease muslims , in the name of minority and some appease majority. secularism is used  like  commercial advertisement. No  party is secular....... I think \"deshdrohi\" is a new English word of nomo dictionary 😃😃😃 HyDer Khoso\\n\\nPakistan army has terrorists and rules of war don\\'t apply for terrorist. Now your terrorists will patrolling along the border will be in constant tension and fear of ending up being beheaded Aap party seats should be zero. Kejriwal is Biggest naatakbaaj in political history She is eyeing the CM\\'s chair.As the old English saying \\'History repeats itself\\'goes ,after the death of MG Ramachandran ,his widow Janaki Ramachandran was appointed CM for a brief period before Tamil Nadu was brought under President\\'s rule in February ,1988.Late MGR\\'s loyalists tried to cut late Jayalalitha to size without success.The rival party DMK won the state assembly elections in 1989 but their rule lasted only for two years before the then Prime Minister on the advice of Jayalalitha imposed President\\'s rule again on the state.Jayalalitha led AIADMK won the 1991 assembly elections and she was sworn in as Chief Minister .If Sashikala Natarajan  tried to take over as CM then a split in the party is imminent. Arpit Bardiya they think rajnikanth thought of reviewing baahubali. Little did they know that Prasant Maheshwari told rajnikanth to do so. \\n#thunderstealer #RealGod i have a  question how she ma0ed such big train gown??? I lived next to a temple for 5yrs, where daily from 6am to 9am there will be bajans going on, but never complained about it. every otherday in india their is festival going on where loudspeakers are used,azan is just for 2 mins mr nigam if you want ban, then ban bajans, all types of loudspeakers and specially late night party where your music is been played and ban music too. Your music also suck otherwise STFU. I do not believe this. Government must see down to the common man. See how common people are suffering. See how people are gathering new notes. Yes he is Wright not to join AAP Fudu man 👨 Great. So now you forgot that Lotus is our National flower. Gr8 sir ji  you are right Ppl like u,  takes country back.  To understand PM\\'s thought process u need to have vision.\\nUnfortunately ppl like u doesnt have that vision and happy in living they way live  since independence. Now I understood why srk slapped him People need intellectual brain to understand what Mr Modi is doing... people abusing him are Bewkoof A crowd , mostly of women were protesting against opening of a liquor shop in residential locality. From social point of view protest was ok\\nBut what the Police was supposed to do? Stand there and allow deterioration of situation ? Or dispers the crowd and open the road for traffic.\\nThe legality of opening of the liquor shop lies under drugs and liquor dept. They must have called the police.\\nThe IPS was working under what is permitted by law. \\nHumiliating the officer, lady or any is to be condemned. Hilarious! Great one, mate!!! but ur actions are totally against ur statement. And a vegetarian? What about Porkistan? Porkis are condemned world over. Any one travelling with a Porki Passport is checked thorouhly in any western Country. What was their business? Oil black marketing. Bloody thieves just defaming Islam. Absolutely, regardless of religion. Like & it\\'s not the matter emotional as Mr Bajpayye ji dare to challenged against the Pakistan. Although no any abosulte majority. And the result in the hands of the people. What\\'s the inetiative so far Mr Modi govt with vast majority even today??  Only the creation the great soildier by the govt!! At all the situation not healthy for the govt in near future. And a speech must more demanded by the Pm today without lost time. KKR lose by there own mistakes Though the IITians and other talented people leave our country to get to do what they want, their base (family) is in India. Hence in spite of spending a part of income they earn, they save and remit it to India. Such remittances serve a great purpose of balancing the current account deficit of our country. Hence though they aren\\'t contributing directly at the beginning of their careers, they benefit their families and indirectly our country. Reverse brain drain is a phenomenon that is widespread today. A lot of these talented people left our country because they could not find the right environment in our country to nurture their interest or talent. Nowadays a lot of them return back with distinctions that are recognised throughout the world and are contributing by helping to set up the atmosphere so that in the future, our people need not go abroad. Still waiting for Rahul Gandhi\\'s grand expose of the PM. Why is he not speaking in parliament or doing a speech like this. Where is the Nifty headed too ?

No person cal claim as thier own.. \\ncomnpare this with counterfeit money donated to political parties by cash ....can they clain it as legal tender?

Shame on him. He is doing nothing except making fool to our innocent countrymen. Now lemme prove my points. \\nWhen Modi would campaign for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalites/Maoists. He promised that he would solve Kashmir issue and abrogate article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for army men. He promised to rebut Pakistan in the harshest way possible. He promised to give we youngsters a job/a secured career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again..He promised to bring LokPal...He promised to bring back black money from Swiss bank...\\nBut it\\'s irony that he has done just opposite to what he had promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled even a single promise that he made to us...I think he has cheated all of us...\\nOur Jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals/Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan..We youths are being deprived of jobs by scrapping many government posts and minimizing vacancy..This government is absolutely anti-government jobs...Farmers are committing suicide everyday...Women are being tortured openly...0aland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-India slogans in our national capital\\'s JNU...China is making CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even caring for our concern..\\nI am asking u after all what do we have got by electing Mr. Modi ? Are we not cheated?? Still we all are happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP are speaking against muslims and in support of Ram Mandir...Are we not fools?? Hating muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP?? \\nPlease realize the harsh truth that either BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for..We have to change our perception...Our Jawans at he border are being mutilated and we are helpless..I am ashamed of my PM...\\nJai Hind..... Ms Mira says it is her choice to stay at home and she will do it.Tomm if shahid decides that even he wants to stay at home and be a home maker husband and take care of Misha then how to decide who will be the bread earner???......and what to give her a celebrity status and ask her views?..what is.her achievement till date?...her only master stroke in life is to find a high earning husband.....

Some of Mira\\'s comments may stem from the judgement that full time mothers face today. Feminism is surely about choice. Child rearing is often a group activity and it is up to all the people involved in rearing the child to decide what role each one of them will play. Sometimes, it\\'s a group; grandma, grandpa, mom and dad; so each one of them is able to do other stuff while spending a part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents divide the responsibility. Sometimes, one parent prioritizes work and the other one is a full time caregiver. Sometimes you hire dependable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision. What I find a bit jarring is that she almost seems to shame working mothers for bringing up their children like a \"puppy\". As long as all parties (including the mother) have a choice, then it\\'s all good. I support Sonu Nigam This is the reason for making Tamil Nadu the number one state in Road accidents.

Q1) Are GDP data fudged?\\n\\n- Yes, they are. They aren\\'t accurate. They are being fudged to promote a lie.\\n\\nQ2) Can you prove that the GDP data are fudged?\\n\\n- Until January\\'2015, Indian economy was witnessing its worth growth since the mid 1980s. And then the magic happened. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) changed the way it calculates GDP saying that it was necessary to do so keeping in view the global practices. As a result, India outpaced China and became the fastest growing economy. In 2013-14 our economy grew at 6.9%, rather than 4.7%, which the CSO data showed earlier. Even the country\\'s chief economic advisor, Arvind Subramanian, said “I am puzzled by the new GDP growth numbers. The revised numbers show GDP growth rose from 4.7% to 5.1% for 2012-13 and from 5% to 6.9% for 2013-14. This means acceleration in GDP growth of 1.9 percentage points in 2013-14, just by comparing the new numbers across time\". He also said \"these numbers, especially the acceleration in 2013-14, are at odds with other features of the macro economy\". Almost every economic expert, working in or out of the government ( including Mr Raghuram Rajan), questioned the GDP numbers as they found that the ground realities reflected a completely opposite picture. The new GDP numbers seemed completely in conflict with other economic indicators. According to R 0raj , an independent member of the sub-committee that examined the new methodology to estimate output, the version adopted by the Central Stastical Organisation differed dramatically from the report finalised by the sub-committee in September 2014.\\n\\nQ3) What about the latest GDP data released post-demonetization?\\n\\n- They too are fudged. While the performance of few sectors have been better when compared to their performance in previous quarters, the huge improvement in private consumption (almost doubled) seems highly doubtful amidst the cash crunch during demonetization. It seems that the CSO hasn\\'t been able to map the demonetization effect in its data. Both the government and RBI have also been saying ( just like few of their sensible critics) that the effect of demonetization can be mapped over a longer time-frame. Also, the CSO revised DOWN the Q3 estimates of 2015-16 by 0.3 percentage point to 6.9% from 7.2% earlier, which led to considerable improvement in Q3 2016-17 figures. For those who don\\'t find it surprising, the CSO revised UP Q1 and Q2 estimates of 2015-16. This downward revision of Q3 of 2015-16 has helped in restricting the effect of demonetization in figures.\\n\\nQ4) I am not able to understand anything. Why?\\n\\n- You won\\'t be able to get it. You are neither a statistician nor an economist. Everytime reports and claims like these surface, hustle a little bit on internet beyond Facebook and Twitter, and read about basic things and what experts have to say about them.\\n\\nQ5) But Modi ji says experts know nothing. Don\\'t you think that he is right?\\n\\n- After Hindutva, the best tactic Modi ji has got is misinformation. He has convinced people in believing that experts know nothing. He misinforms people who don\\'t know anything but to believe him. They don\\'t have enough time or will to find out the truth. And when experts question his claims and him, people never understand what experts are saying because they aren\\'t educated enough to understand. Pakistan respect and pay honour to ourneighbors.. Can\\'t even think to insult or mutiliat any person.. There\\'s hidden enemy who is busy in such type of barbaric activities.. Our defense minister Khawaja Asif category denied on this horrible incident.. Indian should believe we Pakistani r peace loving nation. and want good relationship with our neighbors. Be friend. Hate revenge  war is not the solution.. Negotiation. Dialogue is the best solution.. I would like to congratulate CNBC 18 for getting so many record breaking comments. 😂 Never seen so many comments your post. Never knew there are so many hasty and self proclaimed political gurus in the country. Zero level of critical thinking in most comments.

Can u help me plzz .....in my house so mch problems pllz help Ill do any work I support his speech, RSS is divider of country, they do not want to stay peace in India. communal why should he reply congressis??? Congressis should clarify us first, why they kept Muslims in India even after giving them 2.5 times more land/property at the time of partition to insecure Hindus, loot and kill them like Gulshan Kumar through Hazimastan to Dawoodz all over India. I demand Modi G to deport all Muslims living in India as illegal occupants and court to withdraw all human rights to rights from Muslim living in India under enemy property act. modi g just people like us r suffering rich people have ma0ed to again pilled up new curreny only this thing is very painful Don\\'t make statements, better do it general.

Its amazing indian army accept pakistan army enter 250 meters under indian territory and kill two indian jawan and 2nd end pakistan army not accept this if its true then indian army also claim he enter in pakistan territory for operation and start celebrating its surgical strike You should try,LaluG Hahaha \\'Ahmed\\' ! One can only expect this type of lies coz truth does not suit Ahmeds. Hello do Google and check yourself. It was your Drama Kejri who jouned Anna Hazare movement to come to limelight and then suddenly ditched Anna to form party to fool public of Delhi. So better get the fact right before supporting your CONgress and Drama rogue party. Dont write lies just coz it suits your appeasements. Aby chutiya kaun bada bhai ghanta en Mco ko bhai bol raha hai , sidha bomb maro aur Sab ko khatam karo Mco ko why all of a sudden he\\'s having this problem , cause not getting enough songs, I am no his fan now Modijee showed positive attitude to Pakistan with the gesture of going to Pakistan to express the message of peace.We as Indians have learnt to be patient to the maximum until things cross the limits and when it did you could see the answer given for kargil and through  surgical strike for terrorism.The summary is we showed peace as a message through several gestures but when Pakistan kept on 0ging us with terrorism that\\'s were we as a country together supported the surgical strike for which several leftists like her asked for proof and had criticised the move.Showing gestures of peace as a country together to aborher country and showing gestures of antinationalism within the country are two different aspects where anti nationalism even through a post or gesture is highly condemnable at any level.

Dude you want all to love you, but you spread hatred!! It was appalling to hear two very senior army generals Gen Bikram Singh and Lt Gen Pa0 criticising tying of a stone pelter on the vehicle to save lives of amost 25 people including CRPF and Police men. Both these generals claim to have groung experience but have moved away from ground reality. My heart goes out to the young officer who thought of this ingenuine method to save own as well as civilian casualities. All Kashmiris are innocent after the event and claim HR Protection. But when do they realise the same for the uniformed men ? They are also sons of this country. I wish yuo stop callingthese gentlemen for future debates.

I don\\'t know on what basis people are comparing him with dawood. Like yogi is in politics for years now. You need some qualifications to be something. Dawood has nothing to do with CBI.  Dumb people i swear. First they vote for them and then they cry. She will elephants to all. Idols Correct.let cows vote for her too.\\nWe need people who live for people and nature.

It never occurred to me that they were doing wrong because I believed it was important to them and I respected that...

Hahaha..... CNBC team so funny........ make feel happy..... :) :) :) upto large extent it can be resolved,bt v cant say it on this basis only there r several determinants that needs to be taken into consideration... the problem is not with the idea of Demonetization. it was rather overdue since 71. the problem is due to shortage of smaller denominations.. which is partially attributed to the new size of 2000₹ note This is what every business man has to do after age of 60years.I am truly inspired by this..

But we also love and respect our fellow Indians they r our brothers and we expect justice for our brother(pehlu khan, a dairy farmer) and his family for this brutal murder is broad day light.

Burhanuddin, Operational\\nSpokesperson Hizbul Mujhadeen told\\nnews agency that militants didn’t kill\\nthe two bank employees but they\\nwere shot dead by CRPF personnel\\nwho were accompanying them. “We didn’t attack the vehicle with\\nintent to loot the cash. We have\\nenough cash. We condemn the killing\\nof two bank employees and want to\\nclarify that they were shot dead by\\nCRPF personnel and not by militants,” Burhanuddin said adding that\\nmilitants can never target innocent\\nKashmiris. This is one step , there may be more step Sub:- Like of 29/11 attacks can’t be stopped without solving Kashmir problem which can’t be solved without end-game in sight. \\n\\n-----In the entire history of mankind it will be difficult to find another example where a country like India [of six times than Pakistan especially India with better level of advance in science & technology as is evident from ‘Mangal-yan’ the Mars mission] cowardly & helplessly tolerates repeated humiliation by way of armed aggression on it. India is facing such shameful situation for the simple reason that like Pakistan (and Bangladesh) India too foolishly does not understand that the last word on India’s partition is yet to be written.  \\n\\nOne more matter agitates a person like me born before independence and that too in Kota region of my native State of Rajasthan. We were brought up in a culture where a ‘Sainik’ laying down his life in a war was considered getting ‘Moksha’ through ‘Veergati’ [and we were told the stories of Rani Padmini and other ladies of Chittorgarh becoming ‘Sati’ because their husbands got ‘Veergati’ in battle and Hada Rani (from Kota - Bundi given in marriage to Chittorgarh) cutting her head and sending it as a memento to her ‘madhosh’ husband in order to motivate him to fight the battle against enemy and Rana Pratap never submitting to Akabar rather preferred to live in jungles while incessantly fighting to recover the lost forts and mother-land]. \\n\\nThis culture has still remained but when  nowadays I see the soldiers and their officers dying (not in war against Pakistan) but like ‘keede-makode’ (insects) and at the top of it are called ‘Shaheed’ (Martyrs), I get confused whether the culture in which we were brought up was right or the present culture ? (where as a Veteran Colonel said after 29/11 on a TV program that after training of merely 3 to 4 months Jihadi under the very nose of security forces at border etc come from Pakistan and kill the well and extensively trained & groomed Indian soldiers and their officers at Army camp / Corps headquarters)  \\n\\nBut in any case, it is high time GOI realizes that earlier Congress party and now BJP headed by PM Modi and all other political parties in India have been and are incapable of solving Kashmir problem due to their communal mindset. Therefore before it is too late GOI should spare a meager amount of $ 4,400 for the launch of ‘United India Party’ which alone can solve Kashmir and other problems being faced by India. \\n\\nIt is hoped that the Friends-of-India will constrain GOI to see reason as explained at:-     \\n\\nhttp://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spend--4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html \\n\\n[Especially given the fact that India should not waste this opportunity where some Kashmiri Muslims are showing courage and patriotism to start office (with flag and board / banner) of pro-India national political party in Sri0ar and in other parts of the valley where the writ of government of J&K and India does not run and on the contrary Pakistan supported Separatists have been able to inflict almost five months of shutdown on the people of Kashmir]\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nEmail: hemraj_jain@yahoo.com Deport her to canada sge has earned more than required in india try to respect all religions mr nigam Employees of Financial services will never be able to celebrate new year 😀😀😀 Then tell all Khan actors to stop acting and singing in films. What you should know about Turkey\\'s President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:\\n\\nThe Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.\\n\\nErdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey\\'s debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.\\n\\nIn 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey\\'s sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.\\n\\nIn 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan\\'s leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.\\n\\nUnder Erdoğan\\'s government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.\\n\\nBetween 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.\\n\\nFor the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country\\'s high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.\\n\\nErdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the \"Green Card\" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.\\n\\nErdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.\\n\\nIn 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil.

Doucett Black.  Your atheism is out of place in this Christian Nation in which you live.\\n\\nBefore wasting time dredging up the whole “separation of Church and State” fallacy, consider the words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution:\\n\\n”We have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.”\\n\\nThe man who authored our Constitution did not leave any room for doubt about governing ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.  The Congressional records further Christianity as the established religion of these United States of America:   \\n\\nThe process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions. \\n\\n“We do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God’s principles, but we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.”\\n\\nThis intent was well understood, as evidenced by court rulings after the First Amendment. In 1799 the court declared, “By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.” \\n\\nThe U.S. Almanac, while a respected publication, does not constitute the ultimate authority.  Our Founding Fathers, speaking through the U.S. Constitution, hold such authority.  Their position on the topics at hand is indeed upheld by the Supreme Law of the Land, as evidenced by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Perhaps it is you who is “stupid” and needs to educate yourself? Every religion should stop using loudspeakers It is difficult to deal with an army who uses jihadi ISIS tactics.We can\\'t create our own fidayeens because we are a civil modern nation He is not needed by his own party so had to be seen heard This is reason why .... India still far behind other countries .... Everybody want own benefits .... Selfish world ...

Anna ji, lost all the credibility, he earned so far.. either he should be mum like president of India.. or he should join the politics.. he has  no right to say any political leaders of any party until or unless he is partisan to a political party So now you\\'ll raise question if someone is practicing his religion.

He decided not to sign a new deal.

Wake Up......India & Pakistan. India will not forgive this idiot. An amazing momentum that was built with the anti-corruption wave in 2010 saw the death because of this Man\\'s ego and delusions of grandeur. He\\'s a big loser as far as I am concerned He is the man of Visionary.There is lot to do in ground level.I guess in another five to ten years\" if every thing goes fine\" India will have different image and clear government..salute the energy level and determination of our PM. Hello people.. did you all read everything..? It\\'s says President of the Divided States of America...not United states of America...🤔🤔🤔 RC Bhargav a legend..daughter and wife look the same age Anna tumhari policy sab jaan gaye hein, bas jo izzat thordi bahut ha bachaye rakhkho wo to umr ho gayee tumhari aur abhi bhi desh ki sanskriti ki wajeh se bache ho warna har jegeh joote pardte Very bad bjp Bajaj needs to upgrade der quality standards first.. competition wid RE comes later Launching of an Indian bike in Indian market with Opera...They have got it wrong right from the launch...The Marketing team really needs a BIG round of applause!!! #paidmedia #presstitute Very  nice  but  difficult .. To find  with  merit ... William First go and check the video, Mallika Arjun khadge first said that not even a dog gave sacrifice from your side and then PM gave him the answer with utmost respect, and what is the problem in raincoat remark? Being in USA, I am really happy to see that Delhi people have voted for bright future!!! Looking forward for good changes in Delhi 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Yes they pelting stone at dog because u bites their children this guy is stupied, he donot know whta is speaking, chutia sala behen ka loda Really excited! fake data to cut rates and loot money..why the fuk home loan rates are not going down..only banks are looting and no action on defaulters..madrchs fku The RBI should immediately withdraw the over the counter note exchange facilities and instead people be asked to deposit the cash in account and withdraw at the same time if they wish so.The long queues will stop immediately.The note exchange should be done only for those persons who are not maintaining accounts anywhere and that too with an undertaking that the person is not maintaining account anywhere and the cash  being exchanged so is for own use Wondering why Educated Ambassador is struggling to pay through Credit/Debit at a Decent Restaurant! Cant imagine that diplomat of a Developed nation is not having a Card and he needs Cash only for Dinner. Kangana is a victim of the mother who gave her birth. She is the victim of woman that she is. She is the victim of life she has. She is the victim of everything n everybody. Lastly, she will be the victim of her death. Is it a fault that Anna Hazare has acknowledged some of the achievements of Modi. Those who are opposed to the BJP ideologies are supporting the other parties. Do anyone think that Kejriwal is having the right approach to the centre. The massive mandate he got in Delhi was taken for granted by him to abuse others. Is this attitude good for a person like Kejriwal. It is absurd to think that what he says is unquestionable and what he does is right. In my opinion his popularity is showing a downward momentum. Can anyone who is inclined to AAP  show a single political party in India which is having foolproof credentials. Ayodhya land dispute: The court also suggested that parties concerned should sit together to arrive at a consensus. If you are born RSS / BJP and your LOKPAL tool helped them to come to power, where is the  question of you joining AAP,  must be kidding ANNA 😅😅😅😅 It\\'s better that you should apply for Citizenship of your Favourite Country PAK & TALK WITH INDIA AS AN AMBASSADOR TO FULL FILL GOLDEN DREAM How does inflation react to all the after shocks of this demon...? Only in INDIA criminal politicians can get Government Job can get World Tour...\\n If you are not in politics and you just made one mirror mistake like fighting with your friend or etc and police put you in jail or filled up a case against you so you can\\'t apply government job as well can\\'t apply for passport.... So will the market surge tomorrow ... the fed meet outcome is anyways priced in .... Now time has come to finish the Pak from the map of world, this is the better time every young man of Hindustan wants to finish the Pak by Hook or crook. Reema coul you please give view on Yes Bank ??? With the presidential elections around the corner, talks of opposition parties coming together to upset the ruling BJP-led NDA have gained momentum. \\nAt a gathering on late socialist Madhu Limaya’s 95th birth anniversary here yesterday, opposition parties discussed the possibility of forging a grand alliance by burying their differences to challenge the BJP in the presidential election.\\nThe opposition believes that a dent to the BJP’s chances of getting their man of choice appointed to the top constitutional post would come as a huge setback for the ruling coalition ahead of 2019 polls So it was never required when ex  pm IG was the PM. Educated idiot Ha..ha..ha..some people controlling a countries law and order...our judiciary is blind in this case...how can see it??? the eye is covered with a black ribbon... For betterment of India you join politics and become honest leader and then bark. And chutias like you are just putting allegations in social media ! Priyanka Chopra looking awesome,, with new dress,,, ,,, 👍👍👍 Deepika wearing nighty dress 😂😂😂 I really like like kangana, whether it\\'s her personal life or professional she is so true n straight forward n doesn\\'t act like a hypocrite . At least someone dare to show Karen Johar his actual face in the mirror.. And c stands for her own not taking support of anyone.. not fearing anyone. I just love her I bought One Plus 2 just about two months ago..2 days back I dropped it and got the entire screen cracked. Though it is working fine.\\nBut I am not able to repair it due to unavailability of service centre in Jammu & Kashmir...\\nIt\\'s frustrating No \\nSame acting ll be there .. \\nbut we ll watch no option !!!\\n😬😜 Brace yourself \"innocent\" terrorists are coming to defend their deeds like they did for kargil in initial stages. Preeti Rawat are you a reserved candidate 😂 Condemn mutilation but What were they doing in Pak territory? Surgical strike? Provide them washrooms in unit.. It is the worst of times; it is the age of foolishness; it is the epoch of incredulity; it is the season of darkness; it is winter of despair; we have nothing before us and we are already in abyss. fraud and fake Goverment only work on Media Totally cooked up story, only an insane will buy it. Yes champ!! We the people of Kerala love our beef, in our plates, well done! Thank u! 🙂 Best PM in The World.... Koi aapko kuch bhi bole...Par aapne sabko hila diya... Whatever  decision u take is always for our best. This story is an example of yellow journalism. One wonders if white Americans can differentiate between BanlaDeshi, Pakistani, Indian Hndu. Any crime is a e terribly  sad matter but to blame government does not seem right. Those Islamists engaged in terrorism are creating misery for innocent Hindus, Muslims and subcontinent origin Christians. Therefore if any thing, one must blame those Islamist indulging in terrorist activity because must eliminate such people. now on wards.....we have to follow new way with banks,,,,in previous days we were deposited our total money and we with draw what ever req. we do....but now on wards we have to do need based deposits only...

Lets not get into religious stuff. Your point on the technical quality of Bahubali taken, Sadat. But on religion, let us not even start a debate on \"uncorrupted\". Corrupting the minds of young children who do not even have the option to choose what is right and wrong, and putting them in front of a Quran to memorize is plain wrong and actually a form of child abuse. Even an ape can be trained to do something if he is forced to do it and not given any choice. Does that make an ape a Haji or an Imam? Nope. Give choices to your kids. And then let them decide which belief suits them. Why does he remind me of Steve Jobs everytime I see him? 😯 ABP : YOU ALL ARE SOLD.

Who is gonna take care of animals which if of no benefit, and population of cows eventually rises. Do some math guys, think also for those farmers, guys here talking with big mouth does not have those sense of hard work required to rear an animal the solution could had been availability of Rs.100 currency in abundance or swift replacement of new currency within say 7 days of announcement. But sadly nothing happened, this has resulted in miseries of common people and taken out wind from the move. Bad experience.

[Not a difficult task.

Not correct puc http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/\\n\\n Dear Indian Express,\\nI feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. \\nA fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake. Sonu nigam, you are desperate. Well first of all muncipal corporation need to keep cows off the streets. Its cows owner\\'s responsibility. Smart guy but he has to come out clean from coal scam..... Such an useless live product launch,comments are more entertaining here than the launch of dominar😂😂😂 There is no comparison between CNBCTV18 and TimesNow. Don\\'t they understand this? One is business news channel and other one news channel. They should compare with ETNOW. I\\'m independent viewer but sad CNBCTV18 should think before they write to prove it. Watching from USA kajriwal is not a working guy he has big mouth Pakistan is damaging hindu temples and in India every day new mosque are coming up. So now what we should do.  In Pakistan Hindus are minority class and in India government is giving reservations in Education and employment.  So should we continue in in giving reservations for Muslims or should stop. If we go on giving importance to Muslims the same people will put us in trouble. U take up queries of ur friends n relatives only...

U guys should teach ur children the importance of nation alongwid religion..... U fool... y u R accusing only AAP? Comparing a kid with a puppy shows how narrow minded n shallow she is!! I wish she could learn something from her seniors (wives of famous actors but independent with well brought up kids) like Sussaine , Gauri Khan!! \\nAbove all, it\\'s a personal choice of each n every person to work or stay at home irrespective of their \"Gender\"..\\nN who has decided the role of male/female in this world or society? That\\'s too silly to say that if one person tries to take place of other in a relationship there will be chaos!! It\\'s a bond n understanding between a couple which results in harmony or chaos!! Mrs. Kapoor, if u wish to work n ur husband thinks of it as u taking his place then it\\'s ur problem..don\\'t convert your personal issue into a stupid public statement!!\\nA marriage is basically a partnership where husband n wife don\\'t fight or rush into taking each other places but share all responsibilities together!!! One or both might wish to work n share house responsibilities together..or one might decide to work while other might decide to take care of house responsibilities!! You should not be making your personal decisions public in such shallow way!! 2000 rs not needed for a growing economic please share your views on this DMC results , a referendum against Kejriwal.He is expected to honour people verdict and step down . \"The police, however, said they would act if they received a complaint. \"The matter is not in our knowledge yet.

Bengalis are half muslims, maybe mamta effect or Bangladeshi affect,  they marry their daughters to kashmiri muslims who do shawl business in kolkotta, I have seen lot of Bengali ladies in muslim homes at kmr Kind , honourable minister ,helps large heartedly to the needy People.

Mayur Jain  we Indians are very innocent we do forget past very quickly, yes in current scenario I can only trust S.C but most Gujarat people knows that our great PM and Amit shah played big roll in gujarat riots. Even Supreme Court also mentioned in ther report. But as usual nothing happnd. How can he possibly pull off the same look while making all these statements. #lazygraphicartist lol No he didn\\'t. But you might be the offspring of an Indian soldier who had a good time when we invaded in 1971. How is it going to compete with RE in terms of design😕 Ya  well. On the bright side atleast the senior was supportive and she is able to do what\\'s right and not succumb to the big-headed crowd-pleasing Mla. Cmcell petitions are answered in time. Only after my complaint in cm cell police filed FIR 626/14 on a fake dr which the p\\nPolice was delayed without taking action on our complaint.

Had u asked UPA govt abt it?? One more express for Indian Advertising is non issue but the way is. About four decades earlier the government was distributing the product free of cost at petty shop, at travelling points and in the offices of ministry of health. Unfortunately the process of family planing discontinued and given up following the aggression being practiced by Mr. Sanjay Gandhi, son of Indra Gandhi during her rule. Stupid people.

Hi Anuj & Sonia please give a view on Hindalco & Jamna Auto please You guys are presstitutes What will a chaddi like you do in AAP? oh God!!! what a pitiable condition in Delhi.These initiatives are okay and nontheless appreciable but moving to eco friendly means of transport and reducing usage of fossils fuels will be the best possible solution.

Here at our Shiv puja committee, the chairman is a musalman friend of mine.           We may be from different culture, but we dont see things your way. If companies stops offering commission to the Dr\\'s & schemes to the chemists\\u200b,the patients will get medicine at affordable prices &also medical sales person will not loose their job.Today the situation is that, poor patient a feeding\\u200b Dr, chemist, distributer, sales person,. all of these are flourishing by poor patients, the sufferer.All these debate\\'s going on the T.V.are of no use, instead the government should inquires thoroughly in this matter &, publish the report openly,so that the people of this country should know the biggest scam going on for decades in India. Will some one tell here that if it was through mortar fire or gun fire from accross the boarder or LOC....how come the bodies were mutilated????? They were hit from a distance ...right...\\nor Indian Army is accepting the fact that Pak army cross the LOC and killed their soldier...???\\nQuestion is it means that it was a real surgical strick from Pak ...\\nand it has been happening continueosly for quit some time ...how could you cant protact yiurself ...?????? Pathetic Army #Rapendian Army Right! And parties like CPM, Congress, SP, who go out and blatantly ask for votes from a particular community promising goodies in return are obviously promoting communal harmony. Well done. You\\'ve cleared this level. Achievement unlocked: d1ckheadedness God bless everyone. I\\'m not a Hindu but still I can\\'t eat beef. When will this forced religiousness end in India. But, who nurtured AK ? Rather than giving like this why won\\'t we give some fixed amount of money for every category of medal winners and invest the money on improving the other sports and facilities in India for our Athletes???? Our minister haven\\'t giving any space for talent rather we see politics here as well. Unless we give up politics in sports we aren\\'t assured of winning medals in 2020 Olympics as well :( Mr. Modi, you should talk like a Prime Minister and not like a gujrati chaiwala.  Every time you.. underestimate national leaders and past and presen chief Ministers of other states.  They have all done good jobs.  Take the case of Gujarat. More than 95 percent the industries including  IPCL, Amul, Reliance to name few were established during the past govts. You must be thankful to them. If they hadn\\'t done it you would not have been able to enjoy the chief Ministership of Gujarat. Similarly because of the good work done by the earlier govts you are now enjoying the Primeministership. Otherwise you would not have been able to make this kind of foreign tours and waste taxmen\\'s hard earned money.  So the humble request to you is not to make voulger comments against past govts and leaders.  One day you will also become \" X \" Prime Minister. Lolz... Best way to keep people away.  I\\'m sure people would be staying atleast 50 feet away from priyanka.. Mohammad Javeed I completely agree with you Javeed Bhai.. so many people  sacrificed their lives to get freedom to our country, if those people had stopped fighting because so many people were dying, we would not be what we are now. These people too can be ranked so, I pay respects for them and I hope no more deaths will happen due to this decision. Their efforts will certainly bring fruits for our future generation without any deviation. The Shiv Sena barely retained its citadel, the results for the Mumbai municipal polls showed on Thursday. But it was the BJP’s show, as the party stunned everyone by improving its tally from 31 to 81 seats. The Congress was almost wiped out in the country’s financial capital.

When u have started blak money clean up pl clean thoroughly Doctors must justify why a Rs 90 drug is prescribed when a Rs 1 drug is available: IMA President Marxism shows you the way out of human misery, though how you practice it depends on your own understanding. The rightist philosophies on the other hand hit a blind alley, just as religious preachers talk of very nice things while practising and endorsing the exact opposite. As regards,  Stalins and Pol Pots, their number in the rightist camp is hugely higher. But we are so used to them that we consider them natural, just as a believer in God accepts everything as will of God. She looked gorgeous. Don\\'t believe us? See for yourself. Great Mam!

So ur here to spread hatred amongst communities just for the sake of cows..! Anna Hazare is playing to the tunes of BJP. He is silent about all the wrong doings of BJP. There may be some problems in the rule of Kejriwal, maybe he is a sort of authoritarian, but with his limited powers, he has implemented lot of welfare measures. We shouldn\\'t ignore that. While the BJP on the other hand is undoing India. They are killing the social fabric and a man like Anna Hazare is maintaining a dreadful silence. The attack against Africans, dalits, minorities in the name of beef, where were Anna then?

May God bless India One thing I want to say don\\'t stick with that fake thing , even if it has happened I would say it was required to control the things as you can see even now also few of the muslims are still supporting pak and having fights .We as a secular country have no issues if they want to go pak and we are happy to live brotherly with other religions including muslims . Only difference is salary addiction is out of necessity whereas other two may not be... But agree all three r dangerous addictions to the life. Why no chutiya liberal & sickular stands for the miseries of Kashmiri Pandits? Why no liberal bukchod returned their awards on their miseries? Why no one shouted slogans in JNU for killing & raping of Kashmiri Pandit women by islamic militants? Modi is least bothered about this chap...teen talak will be banned...a strict law will come and make this kind of muslims straight...life of muslim womens will be secure after this law... Indian express is an anti Hindu publication ..always biased..!!!! Since communists love purges, I guess its time to purge all communists from India, drag these scums out and give them a taste of their own medicine, No theory has failed as many times in history of this world as Communism did, And still watch morons apologising fr it.

All we can do is express our opinion in a constructive manner. It\\'s the fault of the opposition if they can\\'t see reason even if there\\'s concrete evidence. Hoping won\\'t change anything. Accepting reality and using that to change is the best course of action. Pining on hope brings a whole lot of nothing. Well.. The CM can be goon... But this joker is really a tampon... To quote former British Columbia (Canada) premier Ujjal Dosanjih :\"PM Modi is a great campaigner but a mediocre Prime Minister\".The old English saying \"Either you run your mouth or the country\".Needless to say PM Modi has opted for the former.

Nice Read history. There is no definite ideals about Hinduism first. There are so many divisions and practices and you have to keep in mind that India was never a Hindu state under one ruler.

The killer of Nirbhaya can roam free, but police killing Muslim boys before proving anything, being Muslim as if, is antinational.

You are nothing but a nincompoop masquerading as a Hinduism-minder trying to practice jingoism in a state with full of highbrows! Every year you people put wish list for budget, but govt do what they want to do. Expert should be practical enough to discuss only on viable option. What an intelligently written and unbiased, objective article. NOT. TLDR - Pay the charges  because banks are answerable to shareholders for declining profits and they lend more money if they profit more. Also the opposition of  these charges by the government  \"would have a demoralising effect on banks who supported the government’s demonetisation move and had to handle the resultant mess.\" [ Banks did their job once in a blue moon basically]. So if a bank is misma0ed and can\\'t generate enough revenue through lending, it\\'s depositor responsibility to bridge the gap. Now we have our very own Taliban, all those TV channels must be gratified to create an atmosphere of terror. Police should be informed and this should be taken very seriously. With change in American Politics we should expect slump in pharma sector Mitesh very nice learn about how to stand by in market Lets be honest my friend, there have been numerous incidents starting from Afghanistan occupation of USSR that the US supported mujahideens in the name of religion to unite in and fight the non believers in russia.They got brainwashed in the name of religion under a policy of US.This event created the Taliban and Alqeda supported by US.It stuck them in their back is a different story.The dismantled army of Iraq supported by Israel and US as a policy to smuggle oil created ISIS.Russia returned the Afghanistan favour here.The syrian kids killed and the ones orphaned in war will again be brainwashed in the name of religion to fightback and take revenge.The problem is the US state policy for selfish motives .If Trump wishes to change this parasitic US policy then there is a possibility of limiting this threat.However if he still wishes to solve problem by force and confrontation used earlier, the problem will aggravate further.You can\\'t scare the person ready to, die with fear of death... then every institute is overrated, including Ivy colleges.

Very few person, even judges and well known advocates do not understand that continuation of British enacted laws(like Cr Pc, Civil Procedure Code etc. all), passed at the London Parliament in our statute book is nothing but bestowing legitimacy and accepting illegitimate British occupation of India as rightful and legal. Very few people would agree that instead of celebrating Independence day as a day of festivity, we should observe it as a day of national shame. \\nFriends please note that we are still a dominion of British as per the Indian Independence Act, 1947, passed at the London Parliament read with Section 147 of the Constitution of India. honourable former pm we common people don\\'t know which is plundering work or not but think the demonetization scheme will help country for future development and it is not such plunder like 2g scam,coal block.....if you think it will decline GDP and plunder work we will accept it like other....

Those instances in the hindu festivals are rarely 15-20 days per year. Whereas azaan is given on the loudspeakers EVERYDAY about twice or thrice. But then again it shouldnt be turned into a religion/anti religion debate. Its more about public convenience or noise nuisance.

And as u can see Sir, i aint defaming neither supporting any religion here, i m supporting wt is right according to my point of view.. Correct Ahsan bhai, let me tell you no one is supporting kashmiri pandits as they are no vote bank,  but recently govt proposed separate colonies for pandits in kmr but majority community opposed it, they didn\\'t want hindus back in kmr, is it possible in india you will throw all muslims to pakistan, we Hindus are truly secular,  on basis of religion they were thrown out of kmr, labelled as mukbir, kafir and Indian agents MUSLIM + AAPTARD= EXTREME AAPTARD!!! He said right if a goon rioter became CM .Davod can become head of mumbia police The only problem govt facing from the opposition now, is queues in bank and 100 rs. shortage in atms. this can be easily solved. order all banks, on warfoot measure to install POS machines in all milk booths, govt provisional stores, petrol bunks buses and trains and all other retail outlets. popularise with tv advts of pay tms and sbi buddy and all other fund transfer modes. remember millions and millions of debit cards remain idle with the public, and they are not only for withdrawing cash from atm. if these are applied simaltaneously, the situation will ease very quickly. Take steps today itself and very important thing is make the public aware these steps are being taken at a rapid pace and things will become normal very soon. At least if these measures are successful in metros and urbans, there will be plenty of availablity of cash notes which can be sent to rural areas. all depends how fast you act making the public aware govt is solving the problem Delhi too witnessed the hottest morning of the season in the past five years. It was bound to happen . ... what chances did pak have in intellect with India . .... a country who compares Indian mars mission with their low quality missile test ... how can one think that they can even compete with India who is not just a super power in technology but also has a  soft power skills ....... Modiji do one time face to face war with Pakistan. Daag Dijye Missiles . D same akshay kr slapped a poor watchman for not treating his son wth respect This papers analysis is wrong. As usual the Indian media is always uncharitable to BJP. In my view Shiva Sena has been cut to size and shown the door. Had both the parties contested together then shiva sena would have offered BJP 50-60 seats. Now Shiv sena cannot take BJP for granted. Shiv sena should learn to live with BJP otherwise their presence  will be reduced to small areas like dadar. He is nothing but a naxalite in disguise of parliamentarian like bhadwa journos of RNDTV who ISI agents in disguise of journalist Paid social activist by bjp Each statement minister should speak to RBI, get daily allocation for new money, ensure that the money reaches the poor and far flung areas. The bank ma0er / branches should disperse money to the poor in villages and the owners of the tea garden estate (e.g.) they should speak to CM, get allocation of new money from STATE govt (RBI) and disperse money to poor people.  Also the state government should provide the food (rice and Atta) from govt warehouse against the AADhar card. Why and what is the ThinkTank doing???  They should help drive the cause of curbing black money and the new money being seized should be put into circulation  and allocated to bank so that ATM can dispense money. The new money caught till date is 50 Cr. this could be dispensed to more than 250,000 public if given Rs 2000 each Morons... they muted the exhaust note with that pathetic music Watching you interviewing Pence fed up with you and those false accusations against Trump we can see its a set up why can\\'t you all lies that Summer had a script prompted by her lawyer she\\'s a bad actress you make the USA look so stupid all round the world   its so obvious its a fix up are you all stupid.

We understand it\\'s difficult to answer about every stock, why don\\'t you give a overall view on the industry of that particular stock (Representative image) Thiruvananthapuram: According to an intelligence report submitted to the state police chief seven months ago, and accessed by TOI, two \\'recognised\\' religious conversion centres in Kozhikode and Malappuram converted as many as 5,793 people to Islam between 2011 and 2015. Conversions happening in unrecognised centres in the state could be much higher, fear top government officials who, for obvious reasons, didn\\'t want to be named. The report states that almost half of those who converted to Islam are women, and that the majority of these women (76%) are below 35 years. Of those converted, 4,719 were Hindus and the remaining 1,074 mostly Christian. The conversions happened at Tharbiyathul Islam Sabha in Kozhikode and Monunsthil Islam Sabha at Ponnani, two traditional religious institutions in the state \\'authorized\\' to convert people from other religions to Islam. The police report, prepared in connection with the conversion of Nimisha alias Fathima -currently missing along with 20 others from the state and suspected to have joined Islamic State -says that a detailed inquiry is required to verify whether these conversions were under duress, whether there were enticements involved or were voluntary . \"Inquiries are required to know whether this will affect the communal harmony , internal security of the state and nation. A detailed SSB (state special branch) inquiry in Kasaragod, Kannur, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad is recommended to unearth the details,\" the report, sent by then Kasaragod SP , A Srinivas, who probed the Nimisha case in November 2015, said.

I ma0ed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. \\nBut still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. \\nAfter ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.\\nI started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. \\nBut my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. \\nWhat we understand from the synopsis of plight- \\nOfficials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.\\n\\nMy plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account.\\nShall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.\\nSincerely,\\nElembilayi Sadanandan,\\nVishnu Nilayam,\\nChovva, \\nKannur,\\nKerala 670006.\\nMob 9388523453\\n9809274436.\\nEmail e.sadanandan@gmail.com\\nGod\\'s Choicest Blessings be Showered on to all who go through and who reluctant to give justice or who had any role to suffering of mine.

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. \\nA fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake Well this is quite normal .. if the lady can\\'t bear it then she don\\'t even have any OLQs...

May be China already fall in line with Trump by cutting down Steel Production in mid level !! Impacts of these highly interlinked activities on Indian Economy will only be cleared around the month of around Aug, 2017.

If you know anybody who is screeching about Trump\\'s \"islamaphobia\" or \"muslim ban\", perhaps they need to know a few things.\\n\\n1. Sixteen muslim countries bar Israeli citizens from entering. Do any of those people, mentioned above, screech \"Jew phobia\" or \"Jew ban\"? I think not.\\n\\n2. There are Israeli citizens who are muslim. Those muslim Israeli citizens are barred from entering 16 muslim countries. Do any of those people, mentioned above, screech \"islamaphobia\" or \"muslim ban\" about those countries? Do they protest outside the embassies of those countries? I think not.\\n\\nPerhaps anybody you encounter who accuses Trump of \"islamaphobia\" or a \"muslim ban\" should be made aware of those facts, mentioned above. Perhaps they should also be made aware that Trump\\'s Executive Order is a temporary order and not permanent like that of the 16 other countries which have permanent bans.\\n\\nJust for the further education of those who are being led by George Hitler Soros, here is the list of those countries which bar Israeli citizens from entering:\\n\\n    Syria\\n    Iran\\n    Iraq\\n    Yemen\\n    Libya \\n    Algeria\\n    Bangladesh\\n    Brunei\\n    Kuwait\\n    Lebanon\\n    Malaysia\\n    Oman\\n    Pakistan\\n    Sudan\\n    Saudi Arabia\\n    United Arab Emirates wise man Ow...Every Indian  must be proud ..Bcz Every Man of Pakistan Checks Indian Website to see what is going on....

She is one of the most boring. Sonia is excellent. She\\'s a brave, outspoken soul. No mincing words or being overly fake on the show - she was frank and outspoken. The best part was that she didn\\'t care to butter up KJO, knowing fully well that he is powerful in the film industry.

If given right I will choose him again and again. For ur kind information indias true nuclear potential will be achieved bcoz this man faught with everyone in this world formally and diplomatically to get india what it wanted and the entire world was shocked how india got the nuclear treaty signed. He waived off loans of the farmers who are the backbone of this economy not like the current pm.who waived off 7000 crores of just 63 people. There is a big gap when it comes to how an economist thinks for a nation and how a greedy politician thinks. Pak Army intruded into Indian terrirtory, killed indian soldiers, had some laugh cup of tea with biscuits, mutilated their bodies and went back to their barracks, now tell me while this all rubbish was happening what were indian border forces doing watching mia khalifa and sunny leone? Is this the real life, or is this fantasy. Bajaj is bevarsi That will be sensible decision by Trump if he start negotiations with North Korea  instead of   making   threats of war. You cannot underestimate  country with nuclear weapons. This is  not Syria, Afghanistan where you can test your bombs, even there they have not achieved anything substantial except innocent killings. Nothing to say he have his own opinion. These Bengalis always have soft corner for muslims, see around start from Barkha Don\\'t say sir to this bloody sonu ...instead go and slap him Idiot.....

Manmohan  singh   ha ha ...  someone else \\'s mouth piece   has guts to speak..ha ha If you are a man of understanding, then only read this or you can ignore my comment. The lack of space for any political dialogue pushes people to take up gun. The likes of Yasin Malik had given up gun in 90\\'s because they were promised a dialogue by India.

In solidarity Jai Hind closest ally of argentina -brazil ,uragual , paraguay ,venenzuela, u.s ...so hero can sell in those countries ---> \"better not too late hero motors \" Dr. Maanmohan Singh ji\\'s statements today: \\n1. \"Demonetization is organized and legalised loot\"\\nI am still wondering if 2G and coal scam was not.\\n2. It is a Monumental ma0ement failure.\\nI am still wondering if MANREGA was not.\\n3. He also quoted John Kynes\" In d long run we are all dead\"\\nIs that why he let his goons like Raja, Vadra and Kalmadi to loot d country with land, defence, mines and spectrum scams during his tenure because d future is dead?Aren\\'t u d person who killed our future by choosing not to open your mouth then? These are all the dirty deeds of Terrorists who guise themselves as Muslims.  Islam has been hijacked by the Wahabi Salafis to demonise its good name so that Muslims are hated all over the world.  And dont forget the role convincingly played by the international media to pour salt on the gaping wounds caused by all these atrocities on mankind, and Muslims themselves among the highest victims, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen and many in African countries.  These facts explains that these terrorists are not Muslims (in the real sense of the word) but paid proxy armies, nurtured, protected, assisted bt the greatest Terrorists the world has ever seen - Israel, America and GB.\\nThis is the truth, the absolute   truth only known by knowledgeable people. We are all being taken for a long windy ride to make the world believe what  what they want us to believe.  Unfortunately a huge percentage of the world\\'s population took the bait, hook, line and sinker. it\\'s a sports car or a joke......220 kmph and 6500rpm....lol i20 can beat it These udderless party should be kicked out with beef stuffed in their mouth. BROTHER ..............IN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM  , CITIZENS CHOOSE THE GOVT. .................GOVT. WILL TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION IN RIGHT TIME ................IF GOVT.

IN THE NEXT ELECTION ................THIS IS THE \" PEOPLE\\'S POWER \" IN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM .............AND , YOU WILL SEE THE RESULT OR CHANGE IN NEAR FUTURE ................... It may appear rude to working mothers, but Mrs. Kapoor is just stating the fact that she is happy that she has the choice of being there for her child everyday. She understands that her love for her child is more important than the peer pressure of the times to get a job to boost one\\'s ego. It may be difficult for the middle class working mothers to do the same, as they are working to supplement her husband\\'s income and thus ensure a decent life for her family and dependents. It is a shame when wives of rich successful men, get jobs through their husband\\'s recommendations and support, performing part-time mother duties. These positions could have been suitably filled by another needy person, man or woman, that could help another family overcome their hardships. Feminism is a joke in such cases.

Fake news If it is a matter of sleep for hindus then please have a look,,, As per Hinduism a true Hindu is one who is awake in Brahma Muhoorat & do not sleep during that time, Early Morning hours after 4 am is Brahma Muhoorat when a Hindu should not be sleeping.\\nADHAN IS A MATTER OF FEW MINUTES. \\nAnd according to science early wakeup keeps a person happy. while sleeping till late spoils ones health.\\nWell....it is a matter of fact in my area that some prayers in temples are held in early morning and chanting of mantras do take place on loudspeaker in the very early morning for quite a long time. Though it is an area of more than 95% of muslims, we never opposed it then why hindu orthodox destructive minds raising their eye-brows on a matter of only few minutes. Azan is being recited for a couple of minutes.

Sir you have open the doors of competition in the telecom market... Good bless you.. Why does anyone give importance to such tweets? No wonder, people come up with all kinds of trash. Ignore them, for heaven\\'s sake. Sir, illiteracy, poverty, unemployment and insecurity are some of the key issues we need to address on war footing. Unless these issues are not dealt with we cannot hope to see light at the end of tunnel.  Even after 7 decades we are still talking of unscientific form of reservations.  How stupid of our rogue politicians ? They still continue with same malpractice.  We need reservations based on economic backwardness and proper financial assitance with incentives ( like free education, food and material support, employment  etc). When this gap is reduced, things will start falling in line. This Cannot be achieved in a day . At least we can have hope. That means they accepted that they forcefully occupied Tibet and that makes some Chinese official sympathized with the Tibetan people for brutality and oppression they face thereafter. It is welcome news and hope China Free Tibet and live as good  neighbour for long time benefit for both. Tibetan buddhism which came from India now a days is really popular and many Chinese follow the religion,thus it can be their offering  in devotions. Proud moment for india If a conspiracy, why suspended??\\nShould have waited for the investigation. It\\'s not trust vote it\\'s fixed vote for money Or may be, for once, you should look into how real this news really is. Your media is pushing you towards a war the end of which will not be pretty for anyone. Its really good to appreciate and giving that much amount by the government and various other supporters to these winners but we should not forget to encourage and support financially for all those participants specially at the time of training so that we can hope for more medals, not just to satisfy for one or two..... Lol, about 55% of Kerala\\'s population are Hindus, and most don\\'t have a problem with it. What makes it YOUR moral right to speak for them? 55% of the population wrong?

Dwivedi ji: What do u say for the ex PM Man Mohan Singh. In a way you have said the truth. When government employees retire at 60, there is hardly anything left in them and therefore as a rule they retire. But for the ministers, MP etc. this rule does not apply. Are MPs not public servants. PM Narendra Modi says that he is prime servant of the country.

He is a clever man, he know he could also be rewarded like Akshay Kumar in future if he involves in religious debates.

Pls Trump make a wall so that we can have our own Google, Microsoft etc, all our workforce that is contributing to your GDP and then we will talk big. Nice write up. However, before concluding that no gains are in sight, let us keep our eyes open and look for the gains which are overlooked in this article.                                                                                                                                      1)This could still be a paradigm shift. Don\\'t forget that currency has been growing rapidly in our economy. In the words of former RBi governer Subbu Rao \"going up by 15 percent year on year since financial year 2015/16, significantly faster than the trend rate of 10.7 percent over the previous three years.Even increase in e-transactions does not sufficiently explain this increase in demand for currency, suggesting that some other dynamic was at play. The Government’s surprise move was evidently in response to this uncharacteristic expansion of currency in circulation, clearly out of line with the pace of expansion of economic activity.\"  This trend would definitely be arrested if the govt. is serious and continue its efforts sincerely. And the economy could see much lower cash in circulation.                                                                                                                                   2) temporary squeeze in cash is pushing many to move into electronic payments. Convenience and efficiency  will make them move away from cash permanently wherever possible.                                                                         3) With much less cash in circulation, black money locked up in land and gold would not be easily converted into cash. This could reduce the illegal activities too                                                                                                                        4) Lower land and apartment prices would benefit economy eventually                                                                                                       5)All the 12lakh crore reported to be put back into banking system has left a trail. Tax authorities can trace them and this could increase the cost of doing business via parallel economy. what do you think  about  equitas  holding? Such type of idiots have no any qualifications. These type of leaders are shame on indian political system.Ours is a biggest democracy but its a fractured and faulty constitution in todays time.It need Lots of changes.The foul mouth leaders should be punished by voters but our voter think they are very big .its their mistake...just think these dirty pigs are enemies of society and should be thrown out in to gutter which the right place for such stupid leader. Like Nehru who killed Gandhi and his hopes, kejri  to Anna. 1000degree in less earnest.

Because I had read about Gen Kaul who was related to Mr. Nehruji.

Other point related to this i want to make \"Lord has given excellent chance to Arvind Kejriwal but same mind set problem, visited few places in Left wing states and right wing states & discussed with Yogender Yadav, Sanjay Singh, Sisodia & then designed political foundation looking at Nehruvien model and added Karl Marks philosophies.\\n\\nI say with firm conviction and command that south/west parties (BJP is fast getting imprint of this model) should increase their presence across the India so that we can have a fresh ideology, appropriate power sharing, strengthen state-center relationship, understanding of cultural values........

Anna Hazare  is a failure. He could neither introduce a Lok Pal Bill, as he wished, nor could produce a political party to counter Congress and BJP.

Kaleem Bhikari.. I regularly watch CNBC-TV18. This TV Channel is a hub of optimism. Keep it up. We want to get rid of u Indians......why don\\'t u hear our loud cries Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). We expect apology from your side for such a mistake. Another nail by BJP on eating habits,as he f all them BJP do not eat or drink What he said 100 % agreed..think about country..leave these bloody politician who spread hatred and appeasement politics to divide us..hindu muslim sikh isai come forward unite us for betterment of country.

Move is gud but pl ensure atm has sufficient cash. Good luck. I am afraid whether it will work or not. NDTV which is a Bollywood Chamcha is unable to digest the fact that Bollywood is beaten. The Sikhs are a very peace loving community & don’t seek criminal retribution against anyone. Our Gurus have taught us to help other people in need irrespective of their caste or creed. During the days of the Mughals, the Sikhs used to protect the Hindu families & their women from the Muslims. All that they want from the Govt is that a proper & unbiased legal action be taken against the accused in order to infuse some sense of hope into the victims’ families of which they have been deprived for so many years. The Govt also has to provide adequate money & resettlement options for many of the victims’ families who lost their breadwinners in the Genocide & are still living in urban ghettos.\\n\\nTHIS INCIDENT HAS REALLY SHAKEN THE FAITH OF THE SIKH MINORITY COMMUNITY IN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT & MANY OF THE AFFECTED FAMILIES HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY. I distinctly remember those fateful days as I was studying in school in Delhi at that time. For the first time in my life, I felt like being a member of a Minority community in India. Even now, in Delhi & adjoining areas of the Hindi speaking Cow belt, Sikhs are subjected to racist taunts, humiliated & made fun of them due to their unique identity. Even I was subjected to these humiliating taunts during my school days in Delhi.\\n\\nHer only qualification was that she was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was responsible for the Partition of India. You can read the book written by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad in case you have any doubts.\\n\\nIt is very sad that even 27 years after the massacre of innocent Sikhs that took place between Nov 1-3 1984 following Indira\\'s death no justice has been delivered either to the victims of this heinous GENOCIDE nor any of its perpetrators (mostly local Congress MLAs & their Goons) have been tried or brought to book. According to the BBC, early 20,000 SIKHS were massacred in broad daylight all over India within 4 days & the State Police (like the Delhi Police) did nothing to stop this brutal ETHNIC CLEANSING. They merely stood there like mute spectators watching the grisly spectacle being enacted & at some instances, even colluding with the perpetrators. It is not possible to commit such a large scale murder within such a short span of time without the connivance of local Congress MLAs (or maybe even Senior Congress leaders) who, like in DELHI & elsewhere, incited the mobs with Vitriolic speeches to kill every Sikh & gave their Goons the voters\\' lists to aid them in tracking down Sikh Homes, freely offered money, distributed arms & offered financial rewards to their Goons to kill the Sikhs as most of these Murderers were illiterate. THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS LIKE JAGDISH TYTLER & KAMAL NATH ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE. During this time, Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, killed with Iron rods, & their women were taken & raped & their places of worship desecrated. For the Sikh Community it was like another HOLOCAUST. More casualties happened in CONGRESS ruled states (obviously).The State Police became deaf to the repeated pleas by the affected Sikh families for protection as the irate mobs continued their grisly act in on one Sikh locality after another. In many Sikh localities, entire Sikh communities were wiped out. There are photos of people laughing as they were beating the Sikhs to death. \\n\\nI was 13 years old in Delhi when this car0e took place. I have very vivid & painful memories of those days. I am also a Sikh, but luckily we were safe as our residence was in the Delhi Cantonment which was a secure area. Had I been in an insecure area, I would have met the same fate. My Father picked up me & my Sister from our School bus on Oct 31, 1984 as we had to walk a slight distance to our house. I remember the entire city being under curfew, between Nov 1-4, 1984 & I did not go to school for a month. An eerie silence of Death was pervading over the entire city. For the first time I felt being someone from the Minority community who is living in a country being ruled by the Majority community. I remember seeing black fumes coming from nearby Janakpuri on Nov 1. We had to install Security guards outside our house for a month before things calmed down though we too got threatening phone calls that a mob is coming to our house too to kill us. \\n\\nThe Government has only adopted delaying tactics till now (even 27 years after the car0e) by forming committees after committees to probe into this MASS GENOCIDE, despite repeated testimonies from the Victims\\' families in Court whose near & dear ones where killed in these riots, but sadly, JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED EVEN TILL NOW & the perpetrators & their goons are still roaming scot free. It is obvious the Government is trying to shield them & some Big names are also involved.\\n\\nI feel the Sikh Community should file a case in the International Criminal Court at The Hague as the Indian Govt has failed to deliver justice to the affected families & till the present Govt is there, no justice will be delivered. JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. Till the Indian Govt delivers prompt & effective justice to the victims of 1984 Anti Sikh Pogroms, I won\\'t be surprised if this car0e is again repeated & it will remain as a DARK CHAPTER IN INDIA\\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. Indian Forces are retaliating. Two Pakistani Posts have been destroyed by our Army. It has also been gathered that 7 Pakistani soldiers have died in retaliatory firing from our side against Pak Army.

INDIAN EXPRESS , PL SAID THE POSITION OF YOUR FRIEND CONGRESS ALSO, AND YOUR COMMENTS ARE AGAINST BJP  AND SS GET THE MAJORITY IN BMC....????? it should be conceded that IITs are too much of an intellectual luxury .  They are expected to create more technocrats and scientist and Engineers.  I dare say more 80 % of the IITIANS are in non technical jobs.  Mostly in finance and banking and marketing.  The government should view that seriously.  Only the hardcore engineering aspirants must be given seats in IITS.  Successive RBI governors are IITIANS. India has no option gud night have a sweet dreams Boycott Indian express Its so much important for parents know how bad it is to pressurize children at such an early age.

Indian counterpart was told that there has been no CFV from Pakistan side nor mutilation of Indian soldiers bodies. Indian authorities were told that there is unnecessary media hype following the allegations. Pakistan remains fully committed to maint peace and tranquillity along the LOC and expect same from other side and hope\\nprudence is exercised and no steps are taken that may lead to vitiating of environment and affect peace along LOC.\\nA Routine DGMO level hotline is also likely today.

If RBI indeed is sitting on a huge supply of new 500s  they can be quickly distributed from jan 1 and Modi would have salvaged the situation to a large extent. SArthak Sharma Boss sorry , I may not agree with you because you are telling about his corruption but friend pl analyse other leaders irrespective of their parties and you will find that Politicians are 100% corrupt. You may be knowing him that is why you are telling but there are many whom you may not be knowing but are 100% corrupt. In politics you can not survive without corruption at least in India. So according to you it\\'s communal only when Muslims are dead. Other innocent\\'s lives doesn\\'t matter? That\\'s not communal? Dalits are one of those who consumes most meat.

How come she became successful.... 10-15 years down the line we will see her view on neoptism The commies anti national dreams will never materialise Killing of any human in any form is never comfortable with any sensible human being except those killing in the name of religion of peace. Indians like loud noise  and they speak loudly even they are   anywhere in the world. We can feel it in Railway stations, bus srands, meeting places, religious ceremonies, marriages more over in Parliament, state assemblies, local body assemblies etc etc etc. One of the WB GS Dr. Sarkar ( a madical practitioner) also arrested near about 2 months ago on same child trafficking case..... Very unfortunate. Long queues issue  is not that much critical which is discussed again and again, tomorrow it will be normal yes same evm gave khujli 67/70 :( this needs to be investigated No it\\'s not.

It gave too much power to the leaders and removed all power from the people, in theory it should have worked the other way round.

If the court intended to save the people from getting poisoned, it should have banned sale of the banned vehicles on 30th and 31st of March also. Very bad. Poison  hasare No body minds it.

I feel there should be a harmony between the two sexes.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s exactly so offensive about the above statement? You are making this an issue about women who HAVE to work to support their family financially. She wasn\\'t criticizing that at all. In fact, nobody does. We all applaud such women. \\n\\nYou called her a twit when you don\\'t even possess either the basic decency to read about an issue before commenting on it or you don\\'t even have the IQ to understand her simple statement. And yet hindus of kerala, west bengal, north east india are avid meat eaters, the dalits and the tribal groups of india do consume  huge quantity of beef.\\nWhy drag islam in everything, aren\\'t the dalits,tribals,christians,jews, hindus of some region eating beef? Nice analysis and what I like is \"your optimism and point that if my customer has not loose any money, he will be coming back\". I also liked that you were saying there is no much impact on seeds buying for Rabi and rural economy will be gud but these media people under the compulsion of showing some headlines always ask questions repetitively till they get answers the way they want it. In media no body will look at their channel if they don\\'t make big headlines and keep discussing this event for months.\\nIn Summary good analysis !! all the best !!

All the best to incoming Mr President. what is domestic digital plan and how do see India after 5 years Jio prime deadline is extended...So plz extend Happy New year offer for 15 days also😂😂😂 Pakistan is keep continuing to expose randion ugly face of terrorism by catching one another on one another terrorist who are admiting all the facts that randion raw is involved in all the terrorism is happening in Pakistan. so now Pakistan would lovvvvvveeeee to play its card as well to show what Pak is capable of. like soviet union Pakistan had broken in the history than who is ranida i mean. just disgusting country who is not even a enemy with dignity.. Pak would crush its show off power in the region. Mr.Pawar- Pakistan is terrorist but India ??

Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake. #ExpressOpinion | The elevation of Yogi Adityanath as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is an odious and ominous development.

Moreover it depends how civilized you are the way you living your life more than religion. Religion doesn\\'t make you great human if you are not yourself . You must hear song or music and it doesn\\'t bother you rarely Azan does. I would say, from all religious institutions right now to stop making noise or pollution, not particularly Azan.

Sad I think the police should bring in modern police sedans as used in the USA having a camera recording everything and a computer connected to a central crime database so that everything is recorded on camera. Also, put as much as CCTVs on public transport vehicles so that everything is recorded on camera and hence no eye witness is needed to put perpetrators behind bar on the basis of solid evidence. Also, if any Government official/ servant/ officer is accused of molesting and outraging the modesty of a lady, then he should be suspended immediately and if found guilty be dismissed from Duty. I know the laws are there but the implementation of such laws are very weak. Also, I think the media should keep highlighting the politicians that have criminal cases of rape and molestation against them so that the parties are finally forced to take action on such dirty politicians and kick them out of the party Indians = ??. what the heck did that mean ? you mean confusing DeMo to confuse the nation left him confused .

When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow – 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.\\n\\nThe same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.\\n\\nWhen I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.\\n\\nToday i.e. On 23.03.2017 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.\\n\\nI brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ❤ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station.

Though Indira Gandhi has been rated by you among the greatest Indians, but I don\\'t feel she has done anything Great to be on this list. We Sikhs don\\'t hold her in high esteem. HOW CAN YOU CALL HER A GREAT INDIAN WHEN SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNACCOUNTED DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT SIKHS WHO ARE A MINORITY COMMUNITY? She only created Bhindranwale to counter the Akalis in Punjab & is responsible for the rise of Religious Extremism in the state AS PRIOR TO THAT, THERE WAS NO RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN PUNJAB. Even after her death, 20,000 Sikhs were murdered all over India (4,000 in Delhi alone) from 31st October till 4th November 1984 in a cold blooded Genocide led by the SECULAR CONRESS PARTY OF INDIA. Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, women were gang raped & their property was set on fire. The mobs were laughing as they were killing the Sikhs. The goons were led by local Congress MPS with Govt voter lists in their hands to aid them in finding Sikh houses & properties & were exhorting non Sikhs to kill as many Sikhs as possible. The local Congress MPs even gave the rioters money telling them that the person who will kill the maximum number of Sikhs will get the greatest amount apart from other incentives. From Oct 31 till Nov 3, blood curdling cries of “KHOON KA BADLA KHOON SE LENGE – WE WILL AVENGE BLOOD WITH BLOOD” were broadcast on Delhi Doordarshan & even the renowned actor of Bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan was instigating the people to kill the Sikhs. The Congress was in power at the Centre at the time of the Riots, & P.V.Narasimha Rao was the Home Minister, but he did nothing till Nov 2 despite knowing about the car0e & the Delhi Police just stood as mute spectators instead of protecting the Sikhs & let the bloody car0e to continue as directed by their political masters. Most of the Senior Police Officers deliberately went on leave from Nov 1 to 3 as directed by their political masters.The Army was deliberately not called & were only told to come on the evening of Nov 2, but still there was no one to guide them through the streets of Delhi. Then on Nov 3, after their quench for blood was satisfied, as if by remote control, everything stopped. It was nothing but a cold blooded genocide directed out by the senior Congress politicians against the Sikhs. Had prompt action been taken on the first day of rioting, this Genocide would have never taken place. IT IS A MATTER OF GREAT SHAME FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT STILL THE PERPETRATORS OF THE 1984 SIKH GENOCIDE HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED NOR ANY PROPER LEGAL CONVICTION TAKEN AGAINST EVEN A SINGLE PERSON UNLIKE THE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS IN THE 2002 POST GODHRA RIOTS WHICH HAPPENED MUCH LATER DESPITE REPEATED PLEAS BY THE VICTIM’S FAMILIES.\\nThe killers & murderers are roaming scot free & some are even ministers in the ruling Congress Govt. NEITHER ANY PROPER COMPENSATION BEEN PAID TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 84 RIOTS, NOR HAS ANY PROPER APOLOGY BEEN GIVEN OR ANY MEMORIAL CONSTRUCTED IN THEIR MEMORY BY THE GOVERNMENT. UNLESS THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES ARE BROUGHT TO BOOK, I WON’T BE SURPRISED IF THIS CAR0E IS AGAIN REPEATED.

Police has no time to even collect her PM report & investigation is yet not started to allow the culprits to erase the evidences. No news paper/channel dared to show the news as it has no worth for them. A police person was killed in agitation at India Gate and PM report came to police within 24 hours and MS of Ram Manohar Lohiya Hospital is summoned by the police to be appear in their office.

They have fair elections, open markets, and freedom of religion.\\n\\nYet this is an account of how the charismatic strongmen Narendra Modi, in India, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Turkey, used the power they had won as elected heads of state to push their countries toward authoritarian ways.

She should be bold and strong enough to handle the politicians in such circumstances. First of all she should not have ordered for a lathi charge. Women were protesting for a good cause ie, to stop selling liquor near the villages. After the lathi charge, MLA intervened who represents that village. राजनाथ सिंह जी ने पाकिस्तान पर कड़ी निन्दा की मिसाइल छोड़ दी है बस कुछ ही पलो मे पाकिस्तान नेस्तनाबूद हो जायेगा । Asrar, I said all religions. See I have problems with anyone using loudspeakers be it temple or mosque. Be it azan aur Navratri. 2 wrongs don\\'t make a right. If anyone want to pray, he/she can very well go into his or her religious premise. If he or she wants to pray at home, use technology. I have problems with 5 minutes azan and 5 days of Hindu festival loudspeakers. Naveed shahid, such victories are to be seen as a lesson for Pakistan to stop roguery and twisting the truth... we are not gleeful, we are sombre in our victory and just wish to bring our innocent countryman back unharmed..

Then you made this statement in a filmy style based on whims and fancy .. Probably to make yourself popular by diverting peoples attention.. But ultimately such gimmicks will not fetch what you are trying to become.. Rather it will be counter productive.. Why to make an irrelevant statement which is totally \"inessential\" for you.. This valuable time and energy you could have invested in something productive.. Sadist approach and it is nothing but inflicting injury to self..   If you make this kind of statement in Gorakhpur, Yogi\\'s constituency, the people there including Muslims will thrash you.. He is 5 times continuously MP from there with margin of vote more than one lakh in his favour..This speaks his stature, you are not even a pigmy  in front of him.. jealousy is fire and if you carry it in your mind it will hurt  your mind only where it is lit..

Only superficial.. Months before the civic poll dates were announced, the BJP had sharpened its focus on PMC and PCMC. Dear PM, hope you\\'ll achieve the same.\\nBut you\\'re going too fast and we expect you deliver it as well. The problem with we Indians is we only do \"kaddi ninda\" but when it comes to action we shut... either we are too busy pleasing the western states or too afraid of china.. \\nI just dont understand y we are spending billions on defence if we cant protect our men .. shame why is the girl standing on the table behind you? Oh Man!! I am enjoying comments more than the bike launch :) Do u understand english or not ? Hav i ever discussed abt religion here ?

Karan Kadam did you see it carefully...was it beef or some pigs meat as advised in chapter number 420 ,verse 420😂😂😂😂 We all r with u Sir.. but may I know who is suffering  now.. Again this paper showed its bias.shiv sena  could not win b.m.c  as they have 84 and b.j.p. has81 corporate elected.Bjp has a jump of 50 seats more than the last election and ss has only 9 more  seats this time. Then who has won. Hmm... Good going bajaj... But dont compete with royal enfield.. Coz thats a totally different cult.. And one more thing... Make metal body against plastic body.. Reading the above report carefully it shows that the age of the mother is 20yrs old and the daughter is 4.. that means she delivered her daughter when she was a tee0er herself... no sane pple do that...one is not eligible at 20 to take care of a small child 24*7 ... it\\'s not the norm of today\\'s world... pple want to be free..enjoy life  and not able to do that builds up frustration in them... and then the outcome is this...I know whatever the frustration and choice she made to be a young mother...does not mean she looses her cool to kick the baby..and in the end kill her... sad.... \\n\\nPlz pple these are my thoughts... if u don\\'t agree plz feel free to scroll down\\n...stay happy... Sorry what i am mentioning about this context. My worry as a customer of Axis bank what really happening in this bank officials are involved in too many money laundering and fraud way helping the black money converted to white. What control you have inside the bank. Do you not have any control in the city or branch level.  I dont understand why you are not come publicly and give cofidence to customer. we are worried to keep funds with your bank. The big myth on tax payers in India Data from a Chartered Accountants group.......\\nMr Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant society and presented that only 3.7 crores are  filling ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population .\\n\\nThe reply by CAs : \\n\\nSir, \\nWe have 82 crore voters \\n\\n- 75% are agriculturists ,61.5 crores ( You exempted them directly but, they can also buy cars , bunglows etc as you quoted.. your political counterparts are also enjoying this) \\n\\nBalance..........\\n20.5 crores \\n\\nLess: 24% BPL class ( Below poverty line)\\n\\n15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) .. \\n\\nLess : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below taxable income earners...political class..(say 75%) ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....\\n\\nBalance (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filling it.... \\n\\n.... so almost no gap as Mr Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his country🤓😝😱\\n\\nif Looser Jetly wants more people\\'s to come into tax net ...then... instead foolishly resorting to only rampant raids, surveys...notices... scrutiny ..... demonetisations etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......\\n\\n1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers ( Politicians are also enjoying this )\\n\\n2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ...\\nCome out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )\\n\\n3. Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc... *let Tax payers feel proud*\\n\\n4. Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on basis of average ITR filled... like coverage upto twice of Gross Income in ITR filled for mediclaim and ten times risk cover in case of life insurance \\n\\n5. Introduce Pension after 65 yrs of age on the basis of tax paid by tax payer during his working life..\\n\\nLet honest taxpayers get certain direct benefits.... \\n\\nAs on today, 3.3% of Indian population is filling ITRs as compared to 8% of China...adding large agriculturists to Income Tax may shoot the figure to more than 10% .... it may help you to cool your tax terrorism mindset and a tax compliant nation ...😊\\n*LET\\'S SPREAD THIS TO HONEST TAX PAYERS* Are you reminding Indira Gandhi rule when Cong gave slogan India is Indira. Accepting from others generally leads to disappointment.If Anna has real ability, he can produce many kejriwal.It may be possible that kejriwal may himself have left illiterate Anna in present political conditions .

I think problem is not loudspeaker, but \\'loudspeakers\\'. Even when one will suffice in an area, due to many mosques near to each other, they all start Azan. Second thing is Nowadays the problem is that, not everyone sings azan, as it should be. So it sounds very irritating. Most of the Indian maulanas don\\'t know how to sing a perfect azan. Otherwise it sounds very soothing.

Rajnath will say modi will not go on nawab,s birthday know... September 1965 - When the Indian troops were advancing towards Lahore in 1965, they faced severe resistance from the Pakistani armed forces. To boost the morale, the Indian commander told the troops on the wireless communication that Lahore is only 2 - 3 miles away. At that time, the communications were not encrypted and both forces could intercept each others\\' communication. One of the Pakistani soldier also heard this conversation from his bunker. There was a sign near the bunker which read \"Lahore - 14 Miles\". He got out from the bunker, took the sign and moved towards the advancing Indian troops for some yards and posted a modified sign there. It now read \"Lahore - 14.2 Bloody Miles ...

After the movement, particularly after AK making party, Anna Hazare\\'s all comment has been against AK. I have never heard him, speaking against central govt  for Lokpal bill which was main purpose of Anna movement. Does AK is Lokpal? Does AK is important then Lokpal? When Anna is silent on Lokpal and vocal against AK, it seems Anna is in pain and anguish of his own failure and speaking against AK only because he is known and easy  accessible to him!! \\nI think, Anna comments when a paid media goes out to poke him to speak against AK when some thing like political fight occurs in Delhi between Aap and BJP. Anna should look the political fighting and corruption separately before commenting to media. He should speak about Lokpal only if corruption is the only purpose of his thought and movement.... You showed your colour brother...come back after sometime Adam Smith wrote a book The Wealth of Nations. Soina Gandhi should write a book How to Rob The Wealth of Nations Boys and girls of INDIA ...leave this poor guy  alone..they have only one trait \"traitorship\" they are born of denial...so there is no need to be in communication with them..the world ignores them..they are isolated in SAARC..they are isolated..we all know animals know that a calamity is on its way to strike so they get very fizzy and lose consciousness and starts flappering \\n..same is the case here..

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. \\nA fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake Really Mandir in Kashmir..U guyzz killed n dehomed 5lacs Kashmiri pandits...N destroyed lots of temples ..

Even in this debate the woman wins. He is past his prime in Bollywood. He hardly gets to sing for a movie. The new singers have made their way and occupied Central place in playback singing which he enjoyed sometime back. So, now he is frustrated and desperate coz no one is talking about him and his vocals. Hence, the best way possible for him like all losers is talk against Islam and Muslims to get noticed. My request to Muslims wud be to ignore this defeated soul and leave him with his madness and frustration. you people never work on talents ...work on some chuthiar factors No India is better off in BJPs hands but it is very sad that Kerala is in your hands since many murders are taking place in your land Oh Asaduddin Owaisi he is not a good person at all, Our Sikhi Teaches that inside evry person in its soul GOD resides, nd i dont hate his soul bt Mr. Owaisi nature is not a very good one thats my point of view again, few people may find him good too... And as i said Sonu sir isnt a bad person, nd maybe his intention ws to stop noise pollution bt his execution cud hve been slightly different u knw.. Becoz Sonu Sir is a very followed public figure nd he have fans from every religion, so this kind of statement may hurt someone\\'s sentiment.. I mean wts the point in hurting someone, Spread happiness not hatred.. As these politicians are incapable of taking a appropriate decision I humbly request all the three heads of our forces to request the President to give them the authority to take appropriate action to  retaliate and give justice to our brave hearts.

This is what is killing the Indian minds in many ways. Instead of educating the society towards realism, fake situations regresses the minds, taking longer to adapt reality into life, not mentioning creating opportunities and ideas to commit crimes.

He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey\\'s debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.\\n\\nIn 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey\\'s sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.\\n\\nIn 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan\\'s leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.\\n\\nUnder Erdoğan\\'s government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.\\n\\nBetween 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.\\n\\nFor the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country\\'s high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.\\n\\nErdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor.

There will be in constant fear on hoarding even 2000 Rs notes. People have started moving to banking and started transacting thro digital payments and this helps expand tax base.

That\\'s what happens when you skip your education to marry a rich guy 10 years elder to you.\\nBeing a homemaker is your obvious choice but what about independent working mothers & single mothers? \\nMake your own choices but don\\'t run down and belittle women who don\\'t have your luxuries. \\nAnd I\\'m sorry but what makes you think that it\\'s okay to spend just an hour with a puppy? Like how can one even compare. She\\'s ridiculous.Aishwarya Joshi Sreoshi Bagchi Only pigs can admire the capabilities of piggy army of pigistaan(pakistan) Pm cheat with  people \\nReal investigation  report  not published.

I am desperately waiting when beloved Indians will see 10 Pakistani heads for 1 Indian head, 56 inch chest, Stop biryani diplomacy and love letters,Demonetization will end terrorism in the valley. Dear Govt. please implement what you said before Lok sabha election or it was also JUMLA. even tamilnadu has more reservation than prescribed getting married to guy ten years elder to u and while hes going places .. you stay home in the name of motherhood and homemaker is only something who got marid for chilling on someone elses hard money can do.. hard working independent gals have to work to fulfil dreams buy house gve good future and raise independent kids its not your fault. mental illness is in your blood Probably the launch team has got no one to tell them about this worst idea....isn\\'t expected from CNBC Lalu also speaking on ethics and integrity....such a shame Lalu...amoeba by nature criticizing the PM... This applies to all religions, sir. All Govt. Offices should have CCTV camera inside the rooms. Govt policies implemented by civil servants and yet they are the ones most corrupt. So how can Modiji policies succeed? EG Bank ma0ers taking a cut and converting black money to new notes by crores. No wonder there is no new notes for general public Amit Mitra please stop  shut yr mouth, and pour money in the state for development . I do not support any politics Why some people are against to every step of Modi may be they are having black money Well play \"intra day\\' . You will surely lose all your capital.

Forever Surbhi Srivastava super fool like you try hard in every thing else, as beauty is not a fimiliar word for you. I am looking at being the next Chairman Mr Ratan ! Sai Ram, Dont make such comments about IITs from what u read and hear online:  Research wise IITs are excelling like anything.Many of the professors came back from USA ,just to teach and do research in India.Funding to IITs also come from our alumini who have excelled in India and abroad.Many students go abroad for higher education and most come back.IITs collaborate with leading institutes like  DRDO,TIFR,etc and immensely contribute to technical development of nation.As a taxpayee your money invested in IITs  is definitely well spend. You should be more worried about how your taxes are spent  by corrupt politicians who get elected due to lack of good education among voters. & What about 2002 Gujarat State terrorism ????\\nWhich one is the best example of #Bhagwa terrorism. Just asking... Do you as in research houses get fees to cover and research a particular company like in case of credit rating agencies getting it from corporate great news for those who stock holds GVK since  as long............. Omg Dear Pakistani #NDTV, this are not suspected Cow Stealer, People caught them red handed.

It is individual choice of being working mother or not working mother, no one has right to put forth their opinion on others. it is not a competition , rather it is justice to the talent of multi tasking which is not her cup of tea look like. Prayer should be inside mosque not with noise and disturb others on daily basis.

Its not  hurt like Sonu Nigam\\'s and many new generation singers songs with horrible and terrible music in public places. friends we have to understand the ground reality, b\\'coz this will not turn-up in a day or two day protest, only parliament has right amend this procedure. we also love ANNA u never join AAP, u dont know meaning of AAP it is clear that we the people, we never trust leaders in our party. even one day we are able through our so called leaders AK and manish. we never trust even them. we the people aam admi. power lies with us. never make drama to kill our intention. whenever election is there u come in front and start blaming AAP. i warn u and i try to educate u i know ur from RSS background just keep away from our intention. Tough words are not enough. Strike strike and strike......Mr PM your 56\\' chest is on stake.... and we give this banana in the gand of endian randians I think rather than religion it\\'s matter of citizen rights and law and order. In 2005, Supreme Court issued guidelines to turn off loudspeakers between 10pm-6am in residential areas. It did not ask for stop the programs, just don’t use the loudspeakers in that period. It was mainly for the sleep and resy – especially for old, sick and children. It should apply to NavRatri, Diwali, Marriage, temples; and don’t see a reason why it should not apply to mosques. Please please please.... I need huge amount to survive.... Please help me 4,00,000... Don\\'t worry .Pakistan has no strength only serviving on cheap loan amount of China. If it were true, we wud hav also condemn those clerics... This girl is unnecessary projecting herself as victim card and gaining publicity Some of the rural areas no power..so first step we need to take that... I guess I\\'m the only one not fooled by Jio Every political parties sheltering criminals and BJP is not an exception. Since BJP is in power, they know only taking action against opponents, and don\\'t think any other party in power would have taken the revenge like BJP. Just need to tell him who is Allah, wot is Azaan?\\nV need to tell him dat Allah is mine n yours whether u know Allah by many other names such as PRABHU , PARMESHWAR , BHAGWAN , EESHWAR , PAALANHAAR , KHUDA , GOD or ALLAH.\\nSo Allah\\'s orders r same 4 everyone...not only muslims or a particular community Same guy shamed UDF when aadhar was launched... Everything is approximate which anyone can estimate to be any limit..proven data talks and not numbers on speeches.. Income tax is still squeezed from middle class..prices of fuel and other essential commodity is high only He still imposed a worthless corrupt party on us. Thankfully I dint trust him during 2014 elections. And I will never trust him in my life. He was quietly sitting till now, and as he realized that it\\'s time to prepare for 2019 elections he started coming to light. I think he would have got another worthless party paying him under table to campaign for them. What is Modi doing situation getting worst then under MMS\\nHigh time he makes way to other capable PM candidates.How long will we wait for Ache Din Same as BJP will win in Bihar 2015 election!!! Agent of bjp pleas go to hell😃😃😃😃 Are you reporting or giving information. The details of the position of armed forces of India to someone What is crying need of the time is Hindu unity ....otherwise we will be thrown out of this country For Anna his own \\'reputation\\' is much more important than anything else!!! Wither his supposedly venerated humanitarian values and his resolve to cleanse the political  canvas through his fight for an impartial Lok Pal???A Z-secure environment from where he issues statements against his Eklavvya-like student Arvind Kejriwal seems to be his only occupation now! Annaji, i thought at your age the ego takes a backseat but your ego...????!!!Annaji, still we are grateful to you for the churning..manthan..of the socio-politico scene four years back from which the elixir of an Arvind emerged as a saviour of the poor and the humble!! All this congress man can is blame bjp... Naxalites is the problem given by congress itself A shame that he hosted Erdogan in India; a leader who is anti-India. Rohit Sharma felt there is no shame in reaching the final the hard way and lauded team effort after their six-wicket over KKR. Will u consider healthcare as part of developnent? Or rural roads or promoting education of women. Ab iski aukaat hi kya rah gayi hai ki BJP waale inki chinta may duble hon? Bus media Abhi bhi inko cover kar Raha hai. So best remedy is to kill patient imagine the plight of the other hooded  guys/girls on the stage - they must be sweating and cursing the bike and the lady singing - their Badduua will ensure the first 100 bikes have punctures!!\\\\ very soon we will start seeing #EDC machine option in #cashondelivery option, if #ecomerce companies has to retain their business.

Share if you agree! violence against pests! Dont u kill pests when their no. increases? Same thing here too, where there r 5% 10% pests the environment is clean but ut starts deteriorating  when  their population increases above 20%. So, you will join bjp. In India, whether Marxism failed or Marxists failed ? He specifically said abt Muslims and their Azaan. How is dat right? India headed by Namo & Co. perhaps does not deserve a governor like him. not even a single goal congress govt achieved in last 9 year except corruption and high Inflation...... If you have complaints against other loudspeakers early morning, they also need to be following law within decibel limits and timings This policy of Congress is responsible for present situation in Kashmir. Ok papa Ji. Chinese should tc care of their  own economy because IMF said Chinese have huge debt on dem. Sirish Bundar is very intelligent .. no wonder SRK had to slap some sense into him Wht u need kali mirch or as usual burnol PM Modi had best intentions for India.. he is much better than anybody anytime.. but unfortunately I don\\'t think he will win next elections as he is taking tough decisions and Majority of India doesn\\'t want to change... may god be with him... Please search some humanity in Syria too Indian Express ur thought process is rusted.Instead of focusing on the achievement of the boy u people are concerned about him being a dalit.Achievements do not differentiate between dalit or general. Everyday new rules and regulations are introduced by a Income tax department, the finance ministry, the revenue and other bureaucratic secretaries and RBI and all the rules and regulations are arbitrary, unlawful and intended to create harassment to the public at large. There is stiff competition amongst all these authorities in issuing the rules and regulations which can cause harassment to the public. Overaction.. Previously many sportspersons got medals..

These days people blindly vote for religion not development\\nfrankly speaking we need activists of all like minded people who want to experience unbiased development these group of activist should keep a legal check on POLITICIANS, beurocrats to see they are functioning properly and not squandering public money.  This is  only way to save our country from religion based and corrupt politicians There shud b a dislike button in fb. . If she has servants for every work, she cant speak anything.

None of election promise fulfilled. Better go and sell chai now As if China was Waiting for the day Pakistan kills two pigs then they will give statement to make india happy??? 😂😁😂\\nNo Paki or intel media give such news only Lundian media with lollypoop for Public 😁😄😄 A way of thinking : it\\'s not a loss it\\'s an aggregate of savings of per capita household income, savings of hospital expense caused due to accidents after drink and drive , savings on every house income that goes to govt which is earned by either the lady of the house or the man which can now be spent on something better, savings on the stress caused due to fights between the wife and husband due to drinking, savings on the physical abuse happening in so many homes, saving the child from watching the trauma caused by the fights between his or her mom dad people know well. .. #ExpressBlog I confess Hillary Clinton was not the greatest opponent you could have faced.

Working on amending AAI Act to monetise AAI\\'s land bank: Jayant Sinha Honestly, never irritated by azaan! But Ramayans that go on for days ..or normal pujas of hours put on loud speakers, or just wedding DJs are what I find disturbing. Anything for a short time, that too at a time we are obviously supposed to wake up doesn\\'t bother me. Loud speakers, if banned, should be banned for once and all for every single event and religious ceremony! Also this etlection propaganda in Delhi these days, is very disturbing, ban that too. Absolutely true It is hitting new lows for the *greater good* as promised by our beloved PM. Dialogue is un ending. Dialogue should be stoped and real action to be taken. R##* spotted You know it just baffles me how despite so much education and information around, people like you ask such dumb questions. Could you just define what a true Hindu, Muslim or a Christian is supposed to be like? By all means feel free to come to Kerala and do your survey yourself as to whether Hindus here eat buffalo or cow beef. By the way I also have Kerala Muslim friends who drink also. (Jinnah btw ate pork and drank too) So you can do a simultaneous survey on how many true Muslims are there in Kerala. And do remember to share your survey results with everybody. It will be enlightening. Like I said in my comment, Kerala, it\\'s food practices and culture is beyond the understanding of most North Indians like you. WHAT ELSE CAN A POOR CHAP DO?

Step should be taken by Govt immediately to stop this practice and Law should be framed to stop construction upto 200 meter on both side of the road, all such construction should be demolished.

At least some one opened his mouth for majority who hate but kept silent It\\'s DHULAGARH reaction There is a bigger scam all over India in issuing DL and RTO office is most corrupt. Mostly the jurisdiction falls under state and central minister can do a little. However can some legislation come in controlling RTO? problem is morons commenting on things without even trying to understand what is being conveyed.. Government is not there to trouble honest guys in the name of recovering black money..?? Today if the police take your family members to police station and keep them there for three days only to  say that they did it for  catching some thieves would you agree . ?? 50 days is over modi sir do something for money problem Nice look diii I want to upgrade from my 180 CC to 400CC Subhash Shah it means u accept that modi and amit shah r criminals Here some sanghi undhbakt terrorist still doubts on this father and muslims these sanghi too need same boycott from there community My assumption is there is breakdown and i feel we might see February levels. considering FII out flows and demonetization.

No parent wants to be labelled as the father of a terrorist. My appeal to each and every citizen is that please dont criticize or hold this family responsible. Looking at what the young generation is today influenced by it is not the fault of the parents but these youngsters themselves as they believe in Jehad, Freedom from everything and they have this strong conviction that they are right and everyone else is wrong. They unfortunately dont have the patience to demonstrate against the system peacefully. Guns never solved any problems. Guns will lead you to your grave sooner or later.

In fact, we, the well-intentioned people of the country and the world have so many reasons to believe that our own governments lack clear insights, right intentions and adequate efficiency to eradicate this menace that is eating out our social fabric and polarizing us into hateful communities. Adequate, quick and effective punishment to the \\'guilty\\' and no harm to the innocent is the key if we\\'re really serious in winning this crucial war against terrorism. We can associate terrorism blindly with whosoever we want, but the ultimate loss will be to our chances of uprooting this crime against humanity....and our efficiency will always be doubtful if not intention... Actually this ##islamic religion responsible for such a mess up scenario around the world. The pot cannot call the Kettle black ??  India loses the right to accuse other for the same crime that India itself commits routinely to others. India has killed 57 Bangladeshi Army officers in a staged rebellion in Bangladesh who bodies are totally mutilated. India extra-judicially kills Bangladesh Border villagers almost everyday. India has been recently killing its own Muslim citizens for the crime of eating or wanting to eat beef.

I remember the time when I had class 12th board exams and one speaker was just beside my room. I used to curse them a lot. People do not speak when a Muslim or a Hindu is dying of hunger or poverty but will now all gang up against sonu nigam. God bless humanity. All on a sudden, USA , Turaska are showing interest to mediate Kashmir issue and India negating , so, slowly world politics are getting concern about Kashmir, while Pakistan is welcoming the move , India sticks to bilateral resolve of the issue . Attacks on Uri  and Pathankot are the biggest failure of India, which is really a great concern and observed that after those two incidents have made other country very much enthusiastic over Kashmir issue. Naturally from strategic point of view India has to reassess the internal security aspect before entering to all out conflict . It is also observed, that ex generals have concede the intelligence failure in respect of Uri and Pathankot incidents . It is also to be asserted that , how far this type of failure is rooted?

He was killed in the 1999 Kargil War. I was 2 years old when he died. I have very few memories of him. I have more memories of how it feels NOT to have a father. I also remember how much I used to hate Pakistan & Pakistanis because they killed my Dad. I used to hate Muslims too because I thought all Muslims are Pakistanis. When I was 6 years old, I tried to stab a lady in a burkha. Because for some strange reason, I thought she was responsible for my father’s death. My mother held me back and made me understand that Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him. It took me a while to know but today I do. I have learnt to let go of my hate. It was not easy but its not difficult. If I can do it, so can you. Today, I am a soldier too, just like my dad. I fight for peace between India and Pakistan. Because if there was no war between us, my father would still be here. I am making this video because I want the Governments of both countries to stop pretending and solve the problem. If France & Germany can become friends after 2 World Wars, if Japan & USA can put their past behind and work towards progress, then why can’t we?? Majority of regular Indians and Pakistanis want peace, not war. I am questioning the calibre of leadership of both nations. We cannot dream of becoming a first world country with third world leadership. Please pull your socks up. Talk to each other and get the job done.Enough state sponsored terrorism. Enough state-sponsored spies. Enough state-sponsored hatred. Enough people have died on both sides of the border. Enough is Enough. I wish to live in a world where there are no Gurmehar Kaurs who miss their Dad. I am not alone, there are many like me. #ProfileForPeace”. Any thing to grab bigger fishes....

What you should know about Turkey\\'s President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:\\n\\nThe Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.\\n\\nErdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey\\'s debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.\\n\\nIn 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey\\'s sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.\\n\\nIn 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan\\'s leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.\\n\\nUnder Erdoğan\\'s government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.\\n\\nBetween 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.\\n\\nFor the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country\\'s high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.\\n\\nErdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the \"Green Card\" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.\\n\\nErdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.\\n\\nIn 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. why not shoot at sight order for cow terrorists?

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. \\nA fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

More than 70 percent of indirect tax collections  has come from the oil and gas sector which has seen rise in international prices.The govt. should stop announcing immunity for black money hoarders any more as frequent announcements of immunity raises question about the strength of govt.\\'s enforcement machinery.

Zulfikar Hutmara\\nfirst check that how many muslim voted for muslim league in 46&45 elections What Sonu Nigam told is right. Doing Azaan through loud speaker should be banned as it is disturbing many people. There is no compulsion to do Azaan through loud speaker. (especially when mobile phone and alaram are available even with beggars). When the speaker was introduced for Khuthuba speech in Kerala in 1930s, Sadakathulla Maulavi, the then general secretary of Samastha Kerala Jamuathil Ulema quit his position as the speaker mode is against the Islamic fiqh rules. Disturbing anybody by using even for a second is haram as per Islamic law.  If the religious authorities & government is not acting, the matter should be solved through courts. If you remove the Gandhis.

Competition has forced them to open their eyes and stop looting customers. USA, UK, GERMANY, FRANCE and many other countries follow state religion, while they allow other faiths to coexist. However laws of the land are strictly followed regardless of ones religion and no concessions are given. None of the Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,Iran, etc., have churches or temples but in the guise of secularism India has given Muslim followers unlimited liberties of loud sparks for their calls to prayers, subsidies to travel to Macca Madina and various other financial helps. Yet this community, many of them, are dissatisfied. In that case Indian govt should allow them to migrate to Pakistan Banladesh or any other. Muslim country which will take them. Those who support secularism, can also try and emigrate to other countries of their choice if they will be accepted. Creators of constitution have committed biggest blunder and its interpreters of this secularism are propagating this blunder to help their vote bank which is a great shame. It is right. These students are doing all nuisance leaving their studies. Stupids ....Beat them well and put them in lockup for a week. Ram Navami comes once in a year.

To promote the child-rape, baby-girls used to be married off to aged Hindu males, even before puberty ... Polygamy was practiced by most of the Hindu males, especially Brahmins, like Tiwaris, Dubeys, Choubeys etc. ... With religion by their side, some of them used to marry more than 100 Hindu-women, even at the death-bed (infamous Antarjali Yatra) ... After the death of old husbands, the just-married baby-girls used to be made \\'SATI\\' by throwing her on the pyre of her husband ... \\nA bengali film named \\'Antarjali Jatra\\', under the direction of famous director Goutam Ghose was released in 1987. This movie chronicles the evil practices prevalent in Kulin Brahminism like polygamy & ... \\'SATI practice\\', wherein a recently widowed woman would be immolated on her husband\\'s funeral pyre.\\n\\nAll sorts of restrictions used to be imposed on WIDOWS ... on \\'food intake\\', \\'re-marriage of tee0e widows\\', \\'right to property\\', \\'social status\\', \\'recreations\\' et al, whereas no restriction on any kind used to be imposed on WIDOWERS !\\nNow-a-days, Hindus are seen mocking at the \\'Burqa\\' used by Muslims ... But ask any Hindu, why the hell they keep their wives-mothers-grandma under the \"GHUNGHAT\" or compell their Women- folk to use vermilion (SINDOOR/BINDI), when the married hindu-men use none ... They would become speechless ! \\n\\nLet alone the commoner, even the Goddess Sita had to appear for a fire-test to prove his \\'purity\\', she was abandoned by Hindu-God Ramchandra when she was pregnant & forced to live in the Hermitage of Valmiki. Finally, she had to commit suicide ... In the same way Lord Krishna never married to \\'Radha\\' & abandoned her & never met her again, after leaving Mathura for Dwarka ! Though he had 16,100 junior wives, besides 8 Principal queens ! \\n\\nDo you have the guts to name a single Hindu whose Great grand-ma / Grand-ma was not raped by his G. grand-pa / grand-pa when she was just a kid & made her to produce children like a rabbit !!\\n\\nFinally, let me admit that I\\'m a devout Hindu myself ! And I\\'m proud of my religion as it allows me apply my brain to judge between good & bad ... to criticize all the evil customs of Hinduism without fear, shun them, change my \"DHARMA\" to suit the modern age ... AND HERE EXACTLY THE ISLAM IS LAGGING BEHIND ... No change, no scientific proof, no logic, no modification of Religious beliefs to suit the modern time-place, no criticism of age-old evil customs, no difference of opinions are permitted / practiced in ISLAM ... \"INTOLERANCE\" to others is the buzzword in ISLAM !! Its good right. Lesser worry of robberies. People who earn and never payed taxes will have to pay taxes. Its people like you who cannot overcome the simple discomfort you face. You need everything in your hand. Govt is not for that tho. Cashless is best decision result will be seen after total cashless\\nGovt servant will suffer while demanding bribe Why you are sad? Good to see xhange I would like to mention here that about a month ago, I bought a car Vitara Breeza ZDI from One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow – 226005, having Vehicle Registration No. UP 32 HQ 5615.\\n\\nThe very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.\\n\\nAfter 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow – 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.\\n\\nThe same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.\\n\\nWhen I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.\\n\\nToday i.e. On 23.03.207 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.\\n\\nI brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ❤ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station. hallala is a punishment to husband because he gave unnecesary talaq.thst is hifu dont have nither men norcwomen so they dovsucide or put in fire. Only corrupt , traitors , people who always want chaos in the country are against Modi and demonetising... whole nation is with Modi ... we are ok with inconvenience but we need clean and honest India media should be banned discussing on religion  linking to elections. Court could hang him even in start , then how the world will know the real face of india . How you can tell the world indian govt is sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan. So Bahubali released on this beautiful day. So it\\'s got the blessing of Lord Shiva it\\'s an eternal movie nothing can take its place. The moment he is questioned on anything.... he simply looses his cool and start his election speech.... \\u3000 .... He didnt have any proper answers to substantiate his tall claims about #Demonetization so he has to say something inside the house..... I think he must be given every chance to speak within parliament which will expose him more n more.... See the stupidity of indian PM who is worried about summer instead of country \\n\\nIn the 31st edition of \\'Mann Ki Baat\\', Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on a number of topics and issues including VIP culture in our country, bridging the gap between rich and poor, and also encouraging students to try new things during their summer vacations. However, one piece of advice that has really touched a chord with people on social media is PM Modi\\'s suggestion on putting out water for birds and animals this summer. With temperatures soaring across the country, PM Modi suggested children take up this initiative as it will not only help the creatures but also instill empathy in children. People of Kerala will give befitting reply to these BJP idiots. They Are wise than other northern States CAN NIFTY CLIMB EVEN 10,000 i.e NIFTY P/E OF 26+????

Arrangement is made through administrative process.. not by personal choice of doctor u fool👆🏻 @tomar. For him secularism is bootlicking of mullahs.... Thank God India is in safe hands 😊😊😊😊 Mutilating the dead bodies is a war crime under Geneva Conventions. Allegations of Pakistani forces mutilating the two Indian soldiers today are serious and should be investigated impartially. Indian soldiers in the past themselves have been involved in mutilating the dead bodies, not just of combatants but civilians too. In March 2000 at Pathribal, 5 civilians were killed in a stage ma0ed encounter and their bodies burnt, to avoid recognition. The CBI investigation charged a present Indian army General as an accused but army scuttled the prosecution. All such war crimes should be investigated and the culpable punished, whether Pakistani army, Indian army or even militants. Made in russia just painted in india 😂😂😂😂 He would have been expelled from the party 😜 People have to come & go, it\\'s their own prerogative, let\\'s take both events positively.

AIMIM is the anti national party their registeration should be withdrawn. They spreading hatred among community.

Here one junk Yoga guru becomes economic advisor...!!!! Nice moves I just don\\'t understand why PM Modi himself doesn\\'t take any step. I have seen just statements of all the politicians, before and after the elections, nothing has changed. PM Modi should either take control of Home Ministry or appoint new Home minister How can you say that bro? It is the duty of the citizens and the government to care for the minority. Have you heard if the islamic country Bahrain? Do you know how peaceful its there. Watch and learn, a monarchy so good that gives rights, safety,care to all cultures and religions. And back in India, our home we fight amongst ourselves. Why? Eat what you want. Majority and minority shouldnt matter. Its not like we are killing people. Beef for life!

You ran from battlefield when in job and then misled people on black money, Lok Pal.\\nWhat is your standing now? I grew up with respect for cow, I started understanding the its value too for its milk, for giving us the bullocks for our agriculture. Now I live in the west but has never eaten beef because I respect that Indian cow with which I grew, spent my childhood, my youth . Though today the cow in Punjab is only milking cow as the bullock are gone from our villages, tractors have replaced them but still the farmers respect cow. So I will request my Hindu brothers not to use force, killings Muslims to force them to respect cow, change their taste not to eat beef but turn to other type of meat, chicken, fish,  vegetation food, win them over with your argument not force, violence has never won & will not. India will be divided further with hate, violence, aggression. Learn lesson from our past history, if we divided others will rule us. I love India, it is my pride, it is my honour. War is a business for politicians,innocent people loose their life while they bask in their billions. No one should die for any piece of land. Let there be peace In India all the brutality by police forces is on a genuine protesters only... Only difference is that media and political leaders camouflage as something wrong by the protesters.

When the country is in a huge financial trouble and oppostion is accusing him of bribe, he should answer to the point with proof. These kind of sarcastic reply is unprofessional.

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. \\nA fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake. I think DP Fahad such an helpless idiot you are you need doctor What is this,  you can\\'t even spell our Respected PM\\'s name???  #namo Happy birthday Sir suppose person don\\'t have any bank account, than how he would deposit in bank?

When we drive abroad in other countries, traffic fines are huge due to which people take driving as a responsible & careful affair. Drunk driving is 6 months straight jail in some countries.\\n\\nIn India, we shift lanes without indicating, drive drunk, stand after the stop line at red signal and jump them without thinking twice of the serious implications. Non-existence of emergency lanes on roads. People not giving space to Ambulance & other emergency vehicles. I also lost my mother while in ambulance just because few people had more important places to reach and blocked our way. Believe me your perspective of driving would change completely when you are in a situation like that one.\\n\\nSo I fully support government\\'s decision to make the fines at par with the global norms and hope that all the traffic violators get what they actually deserve. My question is where is our all tym world richest BCCI ??

Kudos Sonu Nigam.#sonunigam\\n\\nAnd where as other religions do play loudly on loudspeaker but they don\\'t do it for 365 days and off course they don\\'t start at early morning. Muslims have no right to complain because I know in many parts of India in Muslim dominated areas they forbid or totally stop even morning or evening Aarati in temples even without loud speakers. They are not some milk washed community. Horrible people. The west (America) adores her!

Very very disrespectful comment by her if she has really given this statement. Well what can we expect also from her. Really disgusting.

Undeniable facts about Muslim extremism:\\n\\nDirect quotes from the Quran:\\n1. Quran: 4/89 : “They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah . But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.” [Link: https://quran.com/4/89 ] Translation: Kill all Muslims who leave Islam.  \\n2. Quran: 2/1 : “Alif, Lam, Meem.” [Link: https://quran.com/2/1  ] Translation: Allah and his messengers are always right, and the Quran cannot be doubted”\\n3. Quran: 8/12 : “[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, \"I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip\".” [Link: https://quran.com/8/12 , https://quran.com/8/60 ] Translation: Terrorize all non-believers and people who do not agree with Islam.\\n4. Quran: 98/6 : “Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures.” [Link: https://quran.com/98/6 ] Translation: “People of the Scripture (Jews, Christian and Sabians) and Polytheists (Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains) are all vilest of creatures that deserve no mercy.”\\n5. Quran: 4/3  : “And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].” [Link: https://quran.com/4/3] Translation: “Two, three, four..!!”\\n6. Quran: 5/51  : “O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.” [Link: https://quran.com/5/51] Translation: “Don’t make Jew and Christian friends ”\\n7. Quran: 2/216  : “Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not.” [Link: https://quran.com/2/216] Translation: “Fighting[Jihad] is Muslim’s obligation, even if you don’t want to”\\n8. Quran: 3/85  : “And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers..” [Link: https://quran.com/3/85] Translation: “Islam is the only acceptable religion”\\n\\nPork is banned all Islamic countries, except three.

Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Roman Catholic Church, which may well be the foundation upon which wording of Article 11 were based.\\n\\nWhile it is true that Adams signed the aforementioned Treaty, it should be noted that he also signed the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights; both of which serve to further support Adams’ words as being misconstrued.  That Congress unanimously signed the Treaty is absurd when one acknowledges the whole translation issue.      \\n\\nJohn Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker.  In a letter to Benjamin Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World in the 1630s.  He also believed that regular church service was beneficial to man\\'s moral sense. In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent  Thomas Paine\\'s deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, \"The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.”  \\n\\nIn light of Adams’ Christianity, it is highly improbable that translations from English to Arabic were accurately transcribed.  It is far more plausible that he was rejecting the claims of “universal authority” proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church than anything remotely dismissing the foundation upon the Christian religion.        \\n\\nAdams twice served as the Vice-President under President George Washington.  The words of our esteemed first President, included in his Farewell Address, further dispute any notion that these United States of America are not founded upon the Christian religion; “And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.”\\n\\nThe words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution, clearly contradict the notion that America is not a Christian Nation; ”We have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.”\\n\\nWhile Puerto Rico is a territory of the U.S., they have yet to gain Statehood.  Indigenous languages have yet to take precedence over the English language in any of our States.  Your argument is a moot point until such time as they earn said Statehood.  We are all very much aware the U.S. is not Israel; restating the obvious is senseless, especially when it is irrelevant to the point at hand.  Perhaps it is you who “should read more?” Gundaraj of Owaisi in Hyderabad. \\nGau rakshaks are kid in front of your islamic organizations like Isis, al Qaeda, lashkare Will people vote for 10 years of misma0ement by BJP in MCD ???

Sushil Karra sir BJP Is leading gujrat since 1995. There is no connection in between but as mentioned in my earlier comment that we forget everything when religious matter comes in our Indian mind.

Now they should join prostitution industry Screw both of them trollops By the way whose this GIRL??? Yoginomics\\nFor a moment I was stunned; Maybe like many of his passionate supporters. Why would  BJP commit  a harakiri,antagonize minority ,provide a handle for a section of media and opposition to  mount an attack  with renewed vigour and glee( I told u so!) Will it damage its reputation and put a question mark on its developmental agenda?\\n  But knowing Modi & Amit  Shah,their ability to think far ahead of the rest,I think they have a game plan with far reaching consequence which will pay them rich dividend in the electoral battles down the line.\\n  Suppose they ensure for the next 2 years a splendid  model of governance   with high growth and  peace  coupled with impartial administration they bury the ghost and tag of \\'communal\\' neutralize and silence the critics once for ever !  If the epitome of  right wing  \\'monster \\' can make this paradigm shift then they will succeed in wooing.the minorities into their fold,which hitherto they have  not been able to.\\n  More media  harks upon the negatives more support BJP will get as credibility  of media is at a new low thanks to vibrant social media.

True commitment from Private bank for inclusive growth Solders r martyring        rath will stop in 2019 Top 10 tricks played by the media to control the masses: \\n\\n1. Project \\'everything is fine\\' in default mode- even if they are not - thus lulling sheople into complacency. ( buffer routine \\'news\\', sports, celebrity gossip, science, etc. ). This technique is used by shepherds rearing sheep for slaughter.\\n\\n2. Emphasise individual identity (nationality, religion, state etc.), to ensure subconscious separation ( the divide and rule policy ). \\n\\n3. Contrive \\'voice of the poor\\' / \\'protest power\\' etc., though these do not exist. This deludes people to \\'think\\' they are in control. \\n\\n4. Stage events ( \\'astro turfing\\', \\'shills\\', \\'fake witnesses\\', \\'crisis actors\\' etc. ), to either fabricate \\'mass movement\\', create paranoia or extreme fear, or distract masses from real issues.\\n\\n5. Use sports, celebrities and gossip etc., to divert from real issues ( and shape public opinion ).\\n\\n6. Play key supporting role for big sponsored false flag events, hoaxes, etc. ( for wars, laws, create fear, distract, etc.) Many of your favourite news anchors and journalists are in fact establishment ( intelligence ) officers.\\n\\n7. Portray government as victim of crime ( cheating, assault, etc. ), so that the sheople would not later protest draconian laws against themselves.\\n\\n8. Manufacture extreme fear, through exaggerated claims of disease, enemy power, terrorism, etc., ( to support wars, desensitise or divide people, for example ) \\n\\n9. \\'Media black out\\', ( non reporting leads to ignorance or dumbing down ), or reporting with malevolence, ( stereotyping or demonisation ) - the most common control technique. \\n\\n10. Lastly, and most secretive, the media is owned by a handful of corporations and suppresses other sources of information. Media forms  the \\'matrix\\' - a web of illusions to deceive the masses, and along with \\'politics\\' are both secretly owned by banking families. \\n\\nNext time your favourite news media \\'breaks news\\', ask yourself: \"Is this true, or is this their latest shill / hoax / false flag operation\"? A lawyer defeated in the polls is the Finance Minister who does not know the abc of economics. Befooling the people of India. This was China\\'s response to US\\' accusations: \"That doesn\\'t exist at all\" great decision...will send a signal to all power hungry people wanting to jump to AAP I am an IITian.

He gave a chance for all black money holders to convert into white money. Bank were with no money which was held with black money holders. People are fooled..

This is whatever is done is reply. So u must say in public ! just look at their history how one wardlord has become their main leader and after his death what they did . who were their khaliphahs and how they were killed and how they came to our land and destro;yed our temples and culture . they are nothing but invaders and uncivilized inhumans. so what can you expect from devils. and specially pak punjabis. they are the main source of terrorism in our country. we can respond in their way. why do we bury their terrorist just if they dont accept them to be their own. give those to fire during their cremation. burn them to ashes. and they only know the language of war. you can try to have a word with them . i assure you that never can bring results they have the blood of cruel isis kind of invaders like qasim , gauri and khilji or taimur. they just need to be responded like russia , usa or israel do. if india wont do that. thats liek a virus incurable. all the others expect muslims wanna live a life but life of muslims start after they die . so how many qafeers they killed or converted is the bassis of getting their khuda. oh sorry wrong word . now their khuda is branded as new arabian Allah. so that is the basis of how much they get closer to Allah and how many hoors they get in jannat. they dont have to take anything of humanity. their is no such word in arabina dictionary called humanity . i think its so good that a country like usa or israel is there on earth to stop such devils. we are with israel and usa. #BJP turns all attention towards religion to hide their failures Tital itself is biased.

The complaint that airtel is playing fool with customer: I had gone for plan change on my postpaid number 9789693896. I registered through the website. I was informed that the it will be confirmed in 4 hrs. I did not get any conformation whatsoever. Second time I attempted changing of plan got the same response that this will be confirmed in 4 hrs. Again nothing was received as confirmation or whatsoever. Suddenly an hour back I received a call from chennai saying that the plan change has not taken place and I was advised to contact the call center. When informed to the call center none were capable of doing anything the call was transferred to the ma0er and he repeated whatever the earlier fellows was saying that was ultimately of no use.\\nIf I change plan all the benefits like free internet package offers that was there will be removed. That is the only contention and they refuse take up the request of the plan change in between such that it takes effect on from next billing cycle. but earlier it was done for withdrawing a package but it had an effect on next billing cycle.\\nEvery time they create problem and we have to suffer. Call center or the voice support is simply useless as we have to spend our valuable time listening to their nonsense blah...blah and repeated automated messages.\\nIt is really doubtful that airtel is really interested in resolving the issues of the customer. what about  Axis Bank.?

The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

There would be a lot less hypocrisy once you are gone!! For kashmiri pandits thy hv no answer, as thy can see only their problms only..like thy do remember proper dates n no. Of ppl got harmed bt thy dont remember their deeds behind that..unfortunatly I feel inconvenience and suffered headache by your songs when it play loudly  in public area, Who gives such information duh!!!!! I agree with all the arguments u made except for one. All are not supposed to wake up at the early morning azaan or bhajan. Some peeps have to go to sleep at 1-2 in the late night. ISIS is a terrorist organization for sure . I respect this man for his bravery and this would be a lesson for those brain less people who join ISIS without knowing what Islam says about violence. Quran says , Killing one Innocent is as though as you killed the whole humanity and ISIS kill number of innocent people everyday and this proves they are not real Muslims. \\nSecond , I have heard from many non muslims saying Muslims are supposed to kill Non muslims where ever they find them though this is a mis understanding which I want to clear here; A verse in Quran was revealed during a war at the time of Prophet Mohammad in which the Muslims were ordered to kill the enemies but do not make any harm to children\\'s and women who could possibly be there for some reason \\' It is also mentioned at several places not to initiate a war before they start harming you Plus this verse was revealed only for that particular period of time . There is no verse in Quran which restricts a Muslim to be friend of non muslims or kill any person who is not a muslim. These are all rumors and mis understanding which makes some people sick and they start playing hatred games. \\nSomeone has rightly said; Little knowledge of science makes you an atheist and in-depth knowledge of science makes you a believer .  \\nRespect each others religion and spread love . It will be in direct war with China .The World has one problem and that is China This debate is not going to do any thing its just wastage of time India should take a very serious Action no Diplomatic talk or dodger only action thats what only Pakistan Needs. A strong reply should be given to Pakistan one since for all, thats what we Indian expect from our Govt. But our Govt. is just busy in issuing Idiotic statements in this regard. This is happening a lot... The hartal was against illegal meet stalls not for beef ban..paid news??

General Zia-ul-Haq after seizing power from Zulfikar Ali Bhutto via coup hanged him after staging a fake show of judicial trial in 1977, which hasn’t changed much since then. They have a long history of abducting people, torturing them to extract desired  confession in front of camera, charging with false cases and finally killing them in Kangaroo court style Many more happy returns of the day Bigbasket!\\nProud to be the part of this celebration! Kevin Gaskin.  You\\'re most welcome to search the Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence but you\\'ll not find anything about \"separation of Church and State\" contained in any of them.\\n\\nThomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them, asking why he would not proclaim national days of fasting and thanksgiving, as had been done by Washington and Adams before him. The letter contains the phrase \"wall of separation between church and state,\" which led to the erroneous ‘short-hand’ for the Establishment Clause (U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Amendment I, Article III) that we use today.    \\n\\n“Why do I have a freedom of religion…?”  The answer lay in the Congressional papers as they pertain to our Constitution as we know it today.  The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions. \\n\\n“We do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God’s principles, but we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.”\\n\\nThis intent was well understood, as evidence by court rulings after the First Amendment.  In 1799 the court declared, “By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.” \\n\\nOne must realize that our Founding Fathers were striving to attain “freedom of religion” due to the oppressive authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  It wasn’t only Britain but most of Europe that fell under the awesome authority of Roman Catholicism.  Our Founding Fathers set about to recognize the many denominations of Christianity.  Further, they intended to recognize each denomination equally, as opposed to granting power of control by any one denomination.  Herein lay the misinterpretation of the reckless ‘shorthand’ known as “separation of Church and State.”  \\n\\nA more accurate statement is likely “separation of denominations of the Church and State.”  Such interpretation is wholly supported by the Congressional papers in reference to the statement, “We do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God’s principles, but we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.”\\n\\nAs for the statement, “Most of our founding fathers were agnostic,” that is simply not true.  It is a blanket statement proclaimed by those who oppose religion in general.  Yes, there were agnostics in those days but they were not nearly so prevalent as claimed.  Thomas Paine was an English-American political activist, philosopher, political theorist, and revolutionary.  Although he is considered one of our Founding Fathers, he was shunned for his known agnostic beliefs.\\n\\nJohn Adams is another erroneously accused of being agnostic.  Yet, here is a quote from President Adams in reference to Thomas Paine; \"The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.”  I believe you’ll agree his words regarding Mr. Paine are more than sufficient to dispel any claims of his agnostic beliefs.

Yes, the dead body of that terrorist should be thrown for the animals and birds to eat out... Make them all a lesson, whatever be their religion,  once their guilt is established by the due process of  law... That is not going to solve the problem. We are not limited to MP and MLA elections, we have so many other elections like local body elections, by-elections, etc., and so on. We need to eliminate as many elections as possible because that will reduce the scope for fake currency as well. If an elected representative dies in office, the runner-up candidate should be given the responsibility rather than conducting another election. An elected government can\\'t fall at the behest of few selfish politicians. We need to change rules to make the elected representatives to complete the term or even share power across party lines when there is no clear majority. Conducting elections after elections are bleeding this country. Mean Pak Army Entered J&K Killed and mutilated Bodies, thats called Surgical strike. Carry out autopsy first.\\nMay be killed by cross border fires but Indians were afraid to fetch them in view of Paki fire and animals feasted their flesh..

What should every Indian know about IIT?\\n1.You and I pay taxes.\\n2.Using that tax, government provides subsidy to IIT students.\\n3.IIT students fly to USA and most of them work and settle there.\\nIn short, Our taxes are used to contribute brightest of the brains to USA.\\nPS: Some may argue by quoting examples of Narayanamurthy, Kejriwal, etc. But understand that those are just a handful of them. The majority of them do not contribute anything for the country that provided them education in IITs.\\nSource: Quora Iam seeing some messages who are opposing..These are the one who are  anti nationals holding black..Modi has hit them hardly..they should die dogs death..

And when pigs r gone mad , they r not treated they r shot dead. Our great army men got martyrdom ,take the revenge kill the bastards hard on their land and hard n very hard. I don\\'t why Indian media always want Indians always barking on us \\nSo don\\'t stop Indians keep barking on us Maulana sahib please don\\'t give name of Shariyat and Islam to your foolish practices.. if central Govt bans the triple Talaq than we Muslims are with them.. triple talaq is not Islamic practice so keep your mouth shut.. Pakistan PM\\'s daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Son in law Safdar have also been named in the papers. We support Donald Trump act which is necessary to eliminate religious clericness & safety of Americans. America shouldn\\'t considered only ATM for making money. If immigrants want to live in this country they need to respect US, its people & mix up with their culture & work for betterment of this great country welcoming people from all religions in country but not to spread terror or supporting terrorists for killing innocent people. This is alarming call to Muslim community to come forward to give up religious clericness by protesting agst inhuman acts of terrorists to killing innocent people in name of jihad instead of giving them silent support by keeping silent for their anti humanity acts. They should have to understand that humanity is best religion & help to make this world better place where people of all religions can live in peace without any fear.

Great start for this New Year. :) They are both pretty what is fkin wrong with you guys News on yes bank cutting to half is true ? Is npa start to haunt yes bank ? I personally feel, Muslims should not live in density in any city or state in India. Wherever we are in masses, these things are taking place. As it becomes easy to hide for terrorists in those places. I may be wrong also. You have allowed Malya who owes 9000 corers to banks to go out of country. Universal Basic Income Scheme starts becoming interesting in these times: CEA Why is he in Turkey? I\\'m surprised he even stepped in Turkey safely after all the attacks against Muslim minorities in India. now it looks advani & MM goshi and other terrorists are not in the race for president post.

Go ahed and search for adcom on the web u will find the same phone Excellent move. Now there will be no impact on company\\'s shareholders. In Tamilnadu, they haven\\'t given, reservations on the basis of religion, it has a peculiar demographic distribution of castes, where, more than 76% of people belong to weaker sections of society, so it is shoved into the 9th schedule of the constitution of India.

Nikhil Sinha So you mean to say a country without Muslim is the safest country in the world? Japan(a country with no Muslims) is on the 8th spot of most peaceful countries. Iceland(a place where 0.3% people are Muslim) is on the first place. Clear your misconceptions first about Islam. I salute every working woman who spend quality time with kids and excel at workplace too. Being a homemaker is her choice. That\\'s it. I\\'m skeptical how magnanimous she may be to accept her husband\\'s choice if he intends  to be a homemaker. \\n\\nMen also have equal rights to be at home or work. Most of the parents look for a groom who earns fat-some so that the woman gets the privilege to stay home.  Nobody is born to work. Irrespective of the gender, if one wants to take a backseat in their career, it\\'s the other one\\'s responsibility to take lead. Being a homemaker is one\\'s choice and that privilege can be taken by both man and woman. Bhai.....as the Muslims, not all the hindues hate muslims.....only a handful bhakts cant represent all hindues......we have lived peacefully and i assure you that things will be normal as it was before this jumla govt. let our ulamahs anouce jihad for all and c the sea of jihadis againest amirican dogs F*** u indian xpress...

Neither khujliwal nor this Anna is worth of anything..both are hypocrites Modi ji has any words today or only man ki bat will do Sonu Nigam is a classic example of Hindu Privilege. I dare see a Muslim Celebrity speak of. guess only Hindus consume the toxic lead that makes it way to food via water system after Ganesha and durga idols are thrown in rivers. guess only Hindus inhale toxic smoke from Diwali fireworks. guess only Hindus get late to work when roads sometime entire cites are lock down for Hindus festivals, guess only Hindus are woken up by bells and bajan keerta in mandirs.

False news , just like it\\'s allies west and America People were bullying her for not pursuing career n now she has stated her opinion and people have started judging her... it\\'s her mentality and opinion that doesn\\'t mean working women consider their kids as puppies.. if she thinks like this then poor her These are the Hindu insulters what is he talking about secularism?

Muslims castigate Modi for his policies against Muslims and but turn a blind eye to Erdogan\\'s appeasement of ISIS. #Hypocricy My last and final appeal to PM Sh. Modi Ji, let the war begin and get this over. daily we are facing such coward behavior from Pakistan. The same treatment required in Kashmir also, if any politician favor terror activity shoot them also declaring Terrorist. This should be over by now can\\'t be tolerated any more. We all Indians are with you. That\\'s right the whole video was directed at Arvind Kejriwal!! Massive win ??wat the hell ??BJP gain more that 50 seat compare to 2012 where as sena gain less than 9 seats Bjp IT cell = ISI agent Modiji break the barns and  feed the poor break mills and cloth the poor and break property builders and give shelter to the poor and open the water lines and give the poor. Money is paper and only makes life miserable I thought you will come back stronger.....😂😂😂\\nWhat the hell was that.... \\'Congressi\\'😂 Don\\'t call him.sir he is booth licker of modi idiot Better was firing squad Extremely negative view on BUDGET day by Udyan. another negative view when rajan exits and again negatively on brexit. he is comparing brexit with lehmon crisis.still don\\'t know the way he analyze situation please avoid every view is wrong since Budget. The people who are depositing amount in the bank are black money holders and the deposited money is black money They gave him a fiery short cut to Ja🔫🔫at, where 72 hijda hoores and Ham Lover Ma-HAM-Mad are waiting eagerly  👉👉👉 Height of hatred😁😁😁we can understand how media finding it difficult to project this result😀😀 Then that is also a kind of bribe. These AAPtards will now abuse Anna. Interestingly, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal retweeted the video. IF SO THEY WILL CRITICIZE FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING NEW Its very sad we lost our 2 jawans.  Army should have taken action at same time.  Why should army wait for idiotic politicians decisions and advice.  Due to senseless politicians we are losing life\\'s of Jawans.  Surfical strike is done by our brave solders with the guidence of our senior officers.  None of officers or solders name came on headlines except politicians.  Still political using its for political gains.  Thls leaders should spend 1 hour on border then they realise. Jaswinder Bhai y this stupid question from me....I m not a bjp or rss man......\\n\\nRather I think u AAP guys should be happy....coz the campaigning by large number of big wigs from bjp for just MCD elections, is going to help Kejriwal only & create a negative image for bjp - ke saara kaam kaaj chod kar Municipal council elections me lagge hai......... I as a Delhi sensible Delhi citizen would take it negatively.....\\n\\nSo instead of abusing........ u AAP guys should thank BJP for this foolish move.......coz it will again strengthen the image of Kejriwal/AAP only at national level... Chances  of market  going  down  below  8600 in Oct Disgusting, pyjama chaap throwing around his weight There is nothing wrong or right .....it is the way you look at your own geomentry of the brain ....reorientation for  neil is recommended to fix is brain from the virus *pseudo secularism 11000 or 11 Lakh. In the end, truth prevails and the truth is that Kejriwal delivers! Period!! Nope , why shud they report that??\\n#paidmedia Dear Indian Express,\\nI feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don\\'t even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. \\nA fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake. Other than the WiFi facilities, AAI officials said soon another ATM machine will also be installed in the departure terminal of the airport. In bog trouble?lol...do some research first Sony bhai , your kind off people lives in cuckoos land Rahul sir u r very good analysis. U r very great bussinessman. Defence and development goes hand in hand. We are able to invest in defence becoz we are booming our economy and are world\\'s fastest growing one. China can keep crying we don\\'t pay heed to it. 🖕🖕😂😂 why don\\'t muslims wear \"crescent moon\" on their forehead. A DALIT then I guess it\\'s high time to remove reservation. Because Islam is the most wrongly portrayed blamed disrespected misinformed religion to nonmuslims by media.. If you get a bullet, you get a medal\\nIf you get a medal, you get money Living off his wife\\'s earnings &tweeting...wah re wah..!!! Indian Democracy - highly educated officers have to listen to filthy MLA goons Prashant Singh shame of u bjp poori And what about corrupt politicians?? Imagine what would be happening in coming elections!! This is time invest in bank stock specially SBI & Icici? Kejriwal is the racing horse Unfortunately this is wat indian govt is capable of doing!!!!...i dint vote for modiji to see such crap.. Shore sirf shor hota hai Why not..go for it.. Let there also be rule that when bank ATM is out of CSH or not in service, bank pays the customer in return the same transaction amount. Secondly if customer goes to Bank and if there server is down, let banks pay 8% interest for month than regular 4% for that month. Seems like a win win for both banks and customers. Illness?

The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). \\nWe expect apology from your side for such a mistake.\\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/ Dear Indian express jab ye video dekh rahe the to kya kaan me tel Dal rakha tha tumhari team ne, Dr Kumar vishwas has did a vailed attack on all netas of the country and he didn\\'t favoured anyone. To ye prestitutism kyu. Daru pike reporting karte ho kya?? Like kholi... This post isn\\'t about IIT at all. It\\'s about a student who thought he is going to the right place, only to realise mid-way that he wants his destination changed!! The title and subtitle of the article are misleading. The matter and the title are VERY different. And as Indians aren\\'t good at argumentation anyway, even the readers are discussing the title and not the body of the article!! Lol Excellent movie 👍 Ofc they should be seen as a lowlife. Cause inexperienced opinions won\\'t help anyone. Anyways, your point would have been considered, for you are into IIT. BUT since you haven\\'t seen the real \"IIT\" thing, your opinion is invalid. He is a singer,, but not a wise man ...... \\n\\nIgnore ignore ignore & more ignore him  ...\\n\\nso if he feeling disturbing then he shift to another place where Azan doesn\\'t reachable...... True nationalist...I salute...But, we have many traitors within the country, who are defending terrorists... Demonetisation is a good Idea but poorly implemented and people are suffering. The black money is in overseas and in the form of gold and properties. Modi is failed bringing the black money back and completely failed handling the situation and the GDP is has gone down by 1.2%. It will take 5 years for the indian economy to come back to normal state. The rupee lost 40 paise in the past one month and sensex is down. It will take minimum 6 months for the situation to come back to normal. remember we have only 4 printing press and can print only very limited amount of money per day. we cant print money overseas. people doesnt have money to spent and business are struggling. countries like america australia and uk took 10 years to move towards  digital transactions. It  will not happen in one night for god sake. for a country like india it will take 10 years mark my words. people have died standing lines and whole country is suffering. the worst Idea ever i still cant beleive he is feeling great about this. he cant even talk in the parliament about this. How much is the split of IT business and other business That\\'s a biggest joke they should have gone with someone better and sensible person..... Pak leaders and defence  forces have grown up drinking donkey milk not their mo----er .Their genetic component is to deny and tell lies. High time India puts them in their place . Can\\'t blame the untouchables in India - born to a life of hell. Boring as helll....i can sit thru a lecture in collg, but THIS! GDP and population are growing parallel. Our nation needs to focus on population and job opportunities to all. This may be perfect solution to make our country best in the world. man u  did noting so why i salute u Nice Initiative Sir..I don\\'t understand why doctors are targeted in each matter.. First go and check the spelling of (Mohatama Gandi) 😂😂😂😂 Opposition is opposing coz they are sitting there to oppose whether it is right or wrong. They have shut their eyes & Mind. Is it possible for to take the broom and clean whole of your colony on daily basis. Talk something sensible. It\\'s you and me who can clean ourself. We are not animals who require someone to kick us to do right things. Neither we are slaves of anyone who can treat us the way he wants We keralites love and respect every religion and culture. Irrespective of religion and political preference, everyone in the state will be against this fascism. If BJP seriously want a political stand in Kerala,then they have to play by our rules. Seriously these kinds of gimmicks are not gonna work with us. If u know about gau mutra so much then u must have tried it by urself coz I m interested only in body making not mind. How much ever brain I have that\\'s enough for people like u too much is not good. Any comments on zakir and owasie and their freedom of speech What would you  say if the British still ruled annihilated most of Indians build a great nation and CNBC  would done a documentary showing off great progress of British empire interviewing the brits.... neglecting suffering of Indian.... who are in a ghetto may in Port Blair ...remember we have only got freedom just 60 odd years back and would the one whom we regard Father of nation  be proud of TV 18 network if he were to alive today ? Fully accepted and deserve appreciation for ur worthy lines... He is the best choice for UP after a long spell of Gunda and Jungle Raj UP needs a disciplinarian like Yogi It is a Democratic country. If Yogi is so bad people of this country will get a chance very soon. Need not worry at all. Then express report.. ..total nonsense. It\\'s his wish. Who is this mullana preaching others and interfaring in others religious beliefs ? He\\'s also a citizen of India and have his own religious freedom. Being a CM doesn\\'t mean he do stop believing in the faiths of his religion. Tension prevailed in the village when the police dismounted the loudspeaker from the temple on Ram Navmi after the Muslims objected to its use.\\n\\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154868919463580&id=111445058579 Why does not India or China buy? Fundamentals are good. Guess Indians will just get poorer Bec of Modi demonetization and gold rumor ban. India household own the most gold in the world but value has dropped120 dollars since November 9 Any sensible person will vote for #AAP only. I respect Sonu Nigam\\'s courage. No God prefers noise. Relation with God is very personal matter. Why to cry. How long u keep on giving subsidy? The cost price has 2 b recovered. Why pinned hope he never support kejri. Go back n open tea stall. ..u don\\'t deserve to rule this country Aqeel Ahmad sir go to Google search for the ranks of judiciary. By the way all know about Kasab case and Kulbhushan case. Pakistan in an hidden court, in silence,in few time given death penalty to him but we had taken many years, that too.. in open and also we had given Pakistani media to cover it that\\'s a different thing that your government rejected to admit him as Pakistani. That\\'s the difference between our judiciary. Pakistan also didn\\'t given consular access to us. You know consular access is the basic part to international judiciary. Now say which country has better judiciary. Only one country believed in Pakistani Judiciary and that is Pakistan itself. Your own PM was not happy with the decision of your army court. Your one minister admitted that there are not enough evidence against Kulbhushan Jadhav, despite of that you gave him death penalty. Hahhahhhaa😂😂😂 little kids. 0ging everywhere and always. Grow and have some knowledge about world politics. Sinkandar for your point of view Taliban is peaceful community?

Unfortunately, disturbing incidents happen at the border. Let\\'s pray for peace. [BTW, you\\'ll love this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiCBpKAwnjM Competition is tough bcz necessary goods are being costlier but luxury goods are being cheaper..

Aakash Sinha aiff stands for football , why are they rewarding badminton , wrestling Olympians ? Rajkumar Panthoiren Yeah where shud I go to ask them gulf? Kerala is becoming hub for producing cheap labour for gulf, No jobs there only entrprise producing jobs there r public sector ones. Telling chutiya 10 times wont make your comment intellectual just shows u use same language as gau rakshaks u so abhor. Communism has killed 70 million in China are u defending those deaths? U want that in India dont worry we will give u that. If being a right winger  means defending killing on basis of religion then i guess you should accept that u support an ideology that killed millions will u or ur tiny brain who mastrubates after reading name of FAILED marx is inacapable of irony, or maybe u studied in a madarsa in kerala? Why share if agree ? Looks like a propaganda article. Where the so called secular, now all secular become deaf and dumb. There is one more aspect on road safety  which is how people are getting driving license without even having a knowledge of traffic laws. This should also be given a thought. It is naked truth that all the terror attacks connected with Muslims who were follower of Islam. Islam is great religion but few stupid people are killing innocent people in name of jihad & most of Muslims giving them silent support by keeping silence on their inhuman acts. I just want to convey to our Muslim bhai to start protest agst these devils of humanity who are tarnishing name of our great religion Islam otherwise one day world will be devided as Islam vs other religions which will be not good for humanity. Please help to make this world better place to live & understand the purpose of my comments without prejudice.

Sun of beach India is a Hindu country, secularism is a slow but sure way to convert it into Islamic. As soon as muslims are in majority, all this talk of secularism will be meaningless.\\n\\nYou will find a vast majority of Indian muslims sympathetic to the Saudi regime style shariat laws, banning of other religions in most Islamic countries and justifying the Islamic practices. Many are openly speaking of support for Fatwas against those who speak their minds....they attack those who say the truth. Examples of Tarek Fateh and Taslima Nasreen are there for all to see.\\n\\nSecularism is only a tool to deceive Hindus. \\n\\nSecularism is not a one way street, are muslims secular? If not, india should never make the mistake of being secular. Long back charges on withdrawal were introduced but later had to withdraw. It is unethical. Bank fully utilize clients funds and it was held illegal. Better checkup past experience. The same thing applies on you sir when you are invited in any concert !!

Good move by #Dhoni to quit from ODI & T20 captainship which will enable him to be a #mentor to youngsters and to be a transformational leader to create many more #match #winners and match #winning #captains for #INDIA. Every Cricket match is a project which goes through risk mitigations. Similarly several such risks mitigations recorded in this book. http://www.amazon.in/dp/1946515019/ Muslims get every type of support and voodwillto live in the society as honoured members but what do they give back to the society where they enter as refugees, persons in distress etc claiming that their rule is superior to all others, that they have the right to convert others to their religion , rape them   kill them. it is these that makes the matter different for them. Things will be a lot different if the adopt the policy of live nd ketlive. Good Job, these morons need to be taught a lesson. I don\\'t understand you Muslim people don\\'t live in their own country.. you settle down here are there , out of the crowd .. \\nAnd talking about India and Pakistan matter Yes and BCCI is playing with Indian sentiment in favour of extra money. It is true... BCCI only sees money and not cricket quality or love of the fans... God has more creative things to do than a negative one which make  people suffer. Modi is perhaps incarnation of evil on earth with Amit shah as aide. In last year’s Rail Budget, Railway minister Suresh Prabhu had said that the impact of the 7th Pay Commission would take the operating ratio to 92 per cent in 2016-17 just saying whatever comes to mouth doesnt make a leader. This is very stupid of her to give such statement. Not everybody has a choice to relax on her spouses\\'s money. And for her kind information, even puppies are looked after very well. You cant place your choice as \\'supreme\\' over others. what is her achievement in life- an actor\\'s WIFE! Not to stay in power, but for development, all these issues r important.We must protect cows at any cost. Anna should concentrate on lokpal Black money,terrorist and smuggler all will be wiped out.Off course builders. Two  champions of cricket This is pathetic decision, I feel BJP government is acting against the common Public. The decisions Govt is taking has to be perfect and it should not boomerang on Govt.  Firstly BJP Govt first decision on Demonization has failed in collecting the Black Money from Market and even there is cash crunch in market. If BJP government will take such haphazard decision then public will show non-cooperation on each and every action. Timely rethink on haphazard decisions. Wanna eat Am a NS owner .. Bajaj bikes good only for 2years of purchase . Go for KTM What do you have to say that is rbi going to give its numbers after all demonetized notes and how do you see the market after the earning season Gross. Living in new Jersey and not even half Indian, I am not baffled by your ignorance. Not the right time for such non sense humour India must prevent Pak soldiers to cross LOC and their coming into India stealthily at all cost. For that purpose we should use bullets liberally. At the same time, India should also slap a trade embargo on Pakistan, and urge and  convince the US and other powerful nations to introduce economic sanctions against Pakistan for an indefinite period. Then only this terrorist state would be brought down to its knees. It takes guts to tell the truth in current situation, you are gutsy Latha. keep doing good work. kudos!

Indian Army band performs in Drass    WHEN WAS THE WAR FOUGHT?  The Kargil war, which commenced on May 1999, was announced after the infiltration of Pakistani troops and Kashmiri militants into Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and along the Line of Control (LOC). The intrusion into the area, that divided the Indian territory of Ladakh from the northern areas of the state, had come as a complete surprise to the Indian army and Operation Vijay was immediately launched to flush our enemies from the Kargil sector.   Pakistani soldiers    MASTERMIND BEHIND THE ATTACK  Pervez Musharraf, the then Army Chief of Pakistan, is said to be the brain box behind the attack. Musharraf carefully charted out the intrusion plan, without any specifics from the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was supported and assisted by Leiutenant General Mohammed Aziz. It is said that Musharraf executed the plan while Atal Bihari Vajpayee had responded to Nawaz Sharif\\'s invitation to Lahore and where the duo signed the Lahore declaration.   Conventional modes of war were used    MODE OF FIGHTING  Well-equipped with war weapons, both sides were prepared to launch attacks on one another. The 18,000 feet high-altitude battle in the rocky terrain was fought under extreme low temperatures, in a conventional manner, despite both sides possessing nuclear weapons. India positioned five infantry divisions, five independent brigades and 44 battalions of paramilitary troops to Kashmir and further deployed 60 frontline aircrafts.   Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with army and air force officers salute at the India Gate on Vijay Diwas    THE INDIAN AIR FORCE  On May 24, 1999, it was decided that the operation would be joined by the Indian Air Force (IAF). However, it was stressed that the IAF would not cross the LOC at any cost. The IAF launched bomb attacks on the enemy within its boundary. Tiger Hill, one of the highest peaks in the Drass-Kargil area of the state, became the focal point during the war. After a fierce war of more than sixty days, and with the support of the international community, India recaptured Tiger Hill and pushed the Pakistani forces back into its territory.   School children display a national flag over a displayed Indian army tank to commemorate the day    INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CONFLICT  Pakistan\\'s infiltration to India and the military clash were deeply criticized by many countries and attracted the United States\\' intervention into the crisis. As per a report in the Daily Times, a leading newspaper in Pakistan, India gained the confidence of the US while Pakistan \\'lost its credibility in the eyes of both India and Pakistan\\'. The international community began building pressure on the Pakistani forces and threatened them to withdraw or face isolation. Russia and Israel also came forward to support India\\'s stance.

If you will read my comment, you will see that I am against paid media that will print the speculation instead of solid well researched based on facts news. hi guys plz give a view on jamna auto & bharat forge, u skipped my question day before yesterday What is our pm doing,.. do something,.. full scale war or whatever it takes to revenge please do it... This is not the first time ,.. pakistan should get appropriate retaliation Aqsa Kashmiri# whom are u trying to convince, they are the people who even don\\'t know how to respect a women.... Shameless Anna speaks selectively. I am also from maharashtra and also observe his inclinations towards few and hatred towards others My request to all Indian political leaders, Stop affection to minority politics. If you have a talent & good intention to serve public you will win. Nobody stop you. Yes. During British period navab of Ju0adh organized a grand marriage ceremony of his pet dogs . During the partision he carried his pets to Pakistan and left behind his wives in India . Coz he preaches a different religion but this doesn\\'t stop him from being affectionate towards Muslims. You never raised the same question when Akhilesh Yadav did not do the same. U always are liar Indians from #Gandhi To Modi U R Always Cheaters U bhvng like modi paid spectator...Srskty nvr xpctd atleast from u... We Hindus have elected 540 n more MPs but nobody is capable for HM more than Rajnath Singh ??Yes we know Modiji is greateful on him because he brought him to Delhi from Gujrath but he cant force him on people who don\\'t like his \"Kadi Ninda\"We want action we r ready die once but not a slow death Also Defence Ministery nobody is capable than Jetly ? Parkekar was able honest n patriot more than that he was a decision making minister but unfortunately deference between him n Jetly n Rajnath made him to return to Goa back about his serious actions on stone pelters   n also selfishness of BJP making a Govt only a reason These fake secular rulers never take action neglecting their vote bank They love their party n vote bank more than their mother nation its the destiny of we voters n people of this country especially Hindus I feel this Govt is  as old wine in new bottle nothing more What is the use of our weapons or bombs through them to Arebian Sea n surrender We don\\'t want to see murder of no more soldiers n their mutilated bodies Shame on u   jaihind And that is after increasing fares, reduction in quality service due to increase in corruption. Prabhu - Please bless railways. He is half smart to the point of being a fool😁 is it the good time to buy JSW steels share? You of course! You are the most intelligent and best informed in all administrative matters! It\\'s because of fools like you that naxals and stone pelters are active. Why is media so biased towards modi ? Showing him bad man... politicians who shouting and abusing Shri modi are black money hoarders why you don\\'t ask questions to them He is same joker who got a tight slap from King Khan for his stupid behaviour and he could not do anything. Again he is proving that he is expert in stupidity and nobody can match him in that. Btw who is Shirish Kunder? Shirish is the guy who got a tight slap from King Khan......and he is husband of Farah Khan.......this is his introduction......and media is giving so much importance to a person like him just to target BJP and Yogi ;-) At this time when steel. Is in dumps. ….  \\nno man can help.          ? Its a very serious issue if government is planning to make aadhar identity mandatory Expect to reach 30 kms/day of road construction by March end: Nitin Gadkari Aus media should learn to be civilized and sensible like Clarke! Yes u idiot.\\nKash teri films v itni hi logical hoti. Ha ha.. It happens when half of the population is illiterate....  And half intellectual blind idiots... 8th Nov is the voting day then why thats day is getting so much attention. So, she means to say that the baby is like a puppy to the working parent. Who has to go to work. Isn\\'t her husband a parent to her child too, or is she the only parent. Then according to her statement Shahid should also sit at home. Being a Homemaker is not an easy task. But, this is a very stupid statement. Another substandard dialogue for bhakths! Mohamed Sakhir mere dost kerala kounsa country me hai... \\nHamara Hindustan me hi na... so nose tho gusahenge nose kya dost jo log hindu ko himsa karega hunme laath and etc... be gusahenge... Kill those insurgents  n pak  army.....  But where is our  isro satellite  about which we have cried  to d world n compared  with  usa russia n china......  Oh sorry  isro  busy in broadcasting  serial  n  yogi   n defaming a democratic  cm of bengal.....  Why cant we keep a look on small nation  Pakistan..... Whose permission  is waiting  for surgical strike......   Pak  has sended tribals  in kargil war..... \\n U should  send  d gau rakshak n vhp  in pak....  As army follows rule n order...... Jai hind It ll happening everyday for private buses need to reach on time so that they can make more money and trips. Since this video went viral actions has been taken and RTO had meeting with all private bus owners to stop this nonsense at least now. If u can\\'t compete u hv no business to remain in the business. We r a democracy & an open economy Congress required to accept that lower,medium and common peoples had left faith on them due to their ill planning .They have to accept that there is no leader who can come forward  to take challenge to re-strengthen the party and come atpar with Sh.Narinder Modi &Amit shah BJP Party. ARUNACHAL PRADESH, INDIA - HIDDEN GATEWAY for CHINA\\'S NEED OF SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM \\n=======================================\\n\\nArunachal Pradesh of india, the land of rising sun, undisputed beauty queen of Nature & powerhouse of hydropowers is always been a bone of contention between India & China.\\n\\nBut why china is so adament to have Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet ? Is it mere Riligioustic or Geo-politics or Militaristics or Expansionist mindset of China ? Why China is playing a zero-sum game knowing fully well that India will not part with Arunachal Pradesh  at any cost ? \\n\\nIt is undoubtedly clear to everybody that the CORE GROWTH ENGINE of china\\'s economy has been SUSTAINABLE RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM which has two componants as LOCAL & GLOBAL features. \\n\\nIt is the GLOBAL FEATURE which makes ARUNACHAL PRADESH of India via 0ALAND as GATEWAY for china to the SHORTEST riparian transportation system based upon RIVER KALADIN of MYANMAR to the BAY of BENGAL (through Sittwe Sea Port of Myanmar which will eventually form KOLKATA-DHAKA-SITTWE economic corridor powered by \\'BANGLADESH-BHUTAN-INDIA-NEPAL MULTILATERAL HIGHWAY\\' linked with INDIA-MYANMAR-THAILAND TRILATERAL HIGHWAY thereby effectively replacing NORTH EAST of INDIA as HUB of ACT EAST POLICY of INDIA with BENGAL, INDIA) as current global riparian transportation system takes too much times & distances to cover. That is why CHINA keeps disputing the ARUNACHAL PRADESH thereby giving much irritation to the India and preventing both powerhouses to realise full mutual prosperities.\\n\\nBut this ZERO-SUM game can be reversed by MIGHTY RIVER BRAHMAPUTRA. Having RORO facility at DHUBURI & elevated the status of DHUBURI, ASSAM, INDIA to the status of INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE , river brahmaputra can provide peaceful & sustainable riparian solution to above discussed problem and for this both India & China Government have to build following multilateral economic corridor powered by inland, road & rail networks (taking both Bangladesh & Bhutan Government on-board) , namely , \"DHAKA-DHUBURI-THIMPHU-LHASA-BEIJING (DDTLB) ECONOMIC CORRIDOR \". Sitharam yetchury must be send to the border post and must be asked to stay with the fighting Jawans,then he will realize that keeping the borders is not so easy like what he thinks and speak.He was running to JNU,for solidarity for the terrorist outfits inside the university,why he never show solidarity with our jawans,Iam doubtful for his citizenship in India. Looking at comments section, I am convinced that pro demonetization people are unbiased just because their intelligence... Cong please be silent. This problem created by you. You didn\\'t solve. Now you are peaching others. Modiji knows what to do. So it should be ok to play loud aarti at 5am Muslims r getting lynched every other day by hindu fanatics who r supported by BJP and their communal police. How can Muslims in India be happy? India\\'s tactic to divert attention from Kashmir issue, because India is under tremendious pressure from international community and great struggle by people of kashmir... Right you are Kirloskar ferrous industries ltd allotted shares @ 10/ each later send s stikkers of  5/ to share holders and reduced the prices........then shares must be doubled in Quantity Kill all the people. No corruption . Pure india will cone Salute you Sir , at least you started waiting for the result 👍🏼 Now India will be the fastest slowing economy in the world. What the hell are you talking stupid shut your mouth and get lost'"

Child rearing is often a group activity and it is up to all the people involved in rearing the child to decide what role each one of them will play. Sometimes, it's a group; grandma, grandpa, mom and dad; so each one of them is able to do other stuff while spending a part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents divide the responsibility. Sometimes, one parent prioritizes work and the other one is a full time caregiver. Sometimes you hire dependable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision. What I find a bit jarring is that she almost seems to shame working mothers for bringing up their children like a \"puppy\". As long as all parties (including the mother) have a choice, then it's all good.\n",

Every time you.. underestimate national leaders and past and presen chief Ministers of other states.  They have all done good jobs.  Take the case of Gujarat. More than 95 percent the industries including  IPCL, Amul, Reliance to name few were established during the past govts. You must be thankful to them. If they hadn't done it you would not have been able to enjoy the chief Ministership of Gujarat. Similarly because of the good work done by the earlier govts you are now enjoying the Primeministership. Otherwise you would not have been able to make this kind of foreign tours and waste taxmen's hard earned money.  So the humble request to you is not to make voulger comments against past govts and leaders.  One day you will also become \" X \" Prime Minister.\n",

Child rearing is often a group activity and it is up to all the people involved in rearing the child to decide what role each one of them will play. Sometimes, it's a group; grandma, grandpa, mom and dad; so each one of them is able to do other stuff while spending a part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents divide the responsibility. Sometimes, one parent prioritizes work and the other one is a full time caregiver. Sometimes you hire dependable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision. What I find a bit jarring is that she almost seems to shame working mothers for bringing up their children like a \"puppy\". As long as all parties (including the mother) have a choice, then it's all good.\n",

My appeal to each and every citizen is that please dont criticize or hold this family responsible. Looking at what the young generation is today influenced by it is not the fault of the parents but these youngsters themselves as they believe in Jehad, Freedom from everything and they have this strong conviction that they are right and everyone else is wrong.

Instead of educating the society towards realism, fake situations regresses the minds, taking longer to adapt reality into life, not mentioning creating opportunities and ideas to commit crimes. Then, maybe all this is just modern living....... a living room reality.Even amnesia appears to be a norm in Indian society, according to the soaps.\n",
